</div>

<p>The materials for a life of Willis are rich
enough to be embarrassing. Most of his writings
are, in a greater or less degree, autobiographical;
and it would be possible to make a
very tolerable life of him, by arranging passages
from these in the right order, and linking them
together with a few paragraphs of cold facts.
Then, he lived very much in the world’s eye,
and was constantly talked and written about,
so that there is abundant mention of him in
newspaper files, and in volumes of “Recollections,”
etc., by his contemporaries. In addition
to these printed sources, I have been furnished,
by the kindness of Mrs. N. P. Willis, Miss Julia
Willis, and Mrs. Imogen Willis Eddy, with
private letters, journals, and other MS. memoranda
by Willis, which extend from his school
days at Andover down to a few weeks before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
his death&mdash;of course not without <i lang="la">lacunæ</i>. Although
I have not quoted very freely from these
letters, they have been of the greatest service,
by supplying facts which I have incorporated
with the body of the narrative, and by correcting
or verifying data otherwise obtained.
A biography of Willis could have been written
without them, but this particular biography
could not; and I take occasion hereby to acknowledge
my debt to the ladies whose courtesy
gave me access to this material.</p>

<p>There are many others who have helped my
undertaking in various ways&mdash;too many for me
to thank them all by name. But I cannot withhold
mention of my obligations to Mr. Richard
S. Willis and to Mr. Morris Phillips, the editor
of the “Home Journal.”</p>

<h1>NATHANIEL PARKER WILLIS.</h1>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/line.jpg" width="100" height="25" alt="(decorative line)" />
</div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
1806-1823.<br />
<span class="smaller">ANCESTRY AND EARLY YEARS.</span></h2>

<p>Willis was born January 20, 1806, in the
little old seaport city of Portland, Maine, celebrated
by the “Autocrat” for its great square
mansions, the homes of retired sea-captains. The
town had already made some noise in literature,
as the residence of that wild genius, John Neal;
and on February 27, 1807, little more than a
year after the date with which this biography
begins, it witnessed the birth of its most illustrious
citizen, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</p>

<p>A comparison at once suggests itself between
the subsequent fortunes in the republic of letters
of these two infant poets, fellow townsmen for
some five years. Willis was the earlier in the
field. In 1832, when Longfellow, then a young
professor at Bowdoin College, began to contribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
scholarly articles to the “North American
Review,” the former had been five years before
the public, and was already well known as a
poet, a magazine editor, and a foreign correspondent.
When “Outre-Mer” was issued in
1835, Willis had won a reputation as a prose
writer on both sides of the Atlantic by his “Pencillings”
in the “New York Mirror;” and by
1839, when Longfellow published his first volume
of original poetry, “Voices of the Night,”
his senior by a year had printed five books of
verse. But there is no question as to which has
proved the better continuer. Longfellow is still
the favorite poet of two peoples; a singer dearer,
perhaps, to the general heart than any other who
has sung in the English tongue. His brilliant
contemporary, after being for about fifteen years
the most popular magazinist in America, has
sunk into comparative oblivion.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
fate of all fashionable literature. Every generation
begins by imitating the literary fashions of
the last, and ends with a reaction against them.
At present “realism” has the floor, sentiment
is at a discount, and Willis’s glittering, high-colored
pictures of society, with their easy optimism
and their unlikeness to hard fact, have little to
say to the readers of Zola and Henry James.</p>

<p>Without presuming any native equality between
Willis and the Cambridge poet, it is fair
to add that the former never found opportunity
to deepen and ripen such gift as was in him.
His life was passed not “in the quiet and still
air of delightful studies,” but in the rush of the
gay world and the daily drudgery of the pen;
in the toil of journalism, that most exhausting
of mental occupations, which is forever giving
forth and never bringing in. His best work&mdash;all
of his work which claims remembrance&mdash;was
done before he was forty. His earlier writings
are not only his freshest, but his strongest
and most carefully executed.</p>

<p>Willis is a glaring instance of inherited tendencies,
being the third journalist in succession
in his line of descent. The founder of the family
in this country, and the progenitor of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
subject in the seventh generation, was a certain
George Willis, born in England in 1602, who
arrived in New England probably about 1630.
He was a brickmaker and builder by trade, and
is described as “a Puritan of considerable distinction,”
who resided in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
some sixty years, having been admitted to
the Freeman’s Oath in 1638 and elected a deputy
to the General Court. Probably the most
noteworthy of the poet’s forbears, at least upon
the father’s side, was the Rev. John Bailey, his
ancestor in the fifth generation, a non-conforming
Independent minister in Lancashire, who,
having been silenced and afterwards imprisoned,
escaped to Massachusetts in 1684, and was settled,
first as minister over the church in Watertown,
and later as associate minister over the
First Church in Boston, where he died in 1697.
Increase Mather preached his funeral sermon.
His tomb is in the Granary Burying Ground,
adjoining Park Street Church, and his portrait
in the cabinet of the Massachusetts Historical
Society. What more could a man ask for in an
ancestor? No New England pedigree which respects
itself is without one or more fine old Puritan
divines of this kind. Accordingly, when
Willis began to take that mild, retrospective interest
in his own genealogy which foretokens the
oncoming of age,&mdash;when new twigs upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
family tree give an unthought-of importance to
the roots,&mdash;he bestowed the name of this particular
forefather upon his youngest boy, Bailey
Willis.</p>

<p>The poet’s great-grandmother Willis, born
Abigail Belknap, was granddaughter to this
Rev. John Bailey, and had some traits which
cropped out in her posterity. At the time of the
destruction of the tea in Boston harbor, she cannily
saved a little for private use. She used to
say, “I have got some Belknap pride in me yet;”
and among her favorite maxims were, “Never
go into the back door when you can go into the
front,” and “Never eat brown bread when you
can get white.” The husband of this lady was
Charles Willis, a sail-maker and patriot, who
was present on the occasion when tar and feathers
and hot tea were administered to his Majesty’s
tax-collector in Boston. His position and action
in the affair were represented in an ancient
engraving, bought long afterwards by his grandson,
Deacon Nathaniel Willis, our Willis’s father.
A copy of the same is now in possession
of the Massachusetts Historical Society. The
son of Charles and Abigail Willis was Nathaniel,
the third, though by no means the last, Willis
with that baptismal name; the first literary man
in the family, and the poet’s grandfather. He
conducted in Boston, during the Revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
War, the “Independent Chronicle,” a Whig
newspaper, published from the same building in
which Franklin had worked as a printer. This
Nathaniel senior, as we may call him, was an
active man. He was a fine horseman, took part
in the Boston tea-party, and was adjutant of the
Boston regiment sent on an expedition to Rhode
Island under General Sullivan. In 1784 he
sold his interest in the “Independent Chronicle,”
and became one of the pioneer journalists
of the unsettled West. He removed first to
Winchester, Virginia, where he published a paper
for a short time; then to Shepardstown,
where he also published a paper; and thence
in 1790 to Martinsburg, Virginia, where he
founded the “Potomac Guardian” and edited it
till 1796. In that year he went to Chillicothe,
Ohio, and established the “Scioto Gazette,” the
first newspaper in what was then known as the
Northwestern Territory. He was printer to the
government of the territory, and afterwards held
an agency in the Post Office Department. He
bought and cultivated a farm near Chillicothe,
on which he ended his days April 1, 1831. His
wife was Lucy Douglas, of New London, Connecticut.</p>

<p>His son and the poet’s father, Nathaniel Willis,
Junior,&mdash;the fourth Nathaniel in the family,&mdash;was
born at Boston in 1780, and remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
there until 1787, when he joined his father at
Winchester and was employed in his newspaper
office, and subsequently at Martinsburg on the
“Potomac Guardian.” In the infancy of American
journalism, the editor and publisher of a
paper was usually a practical printer. Young
Nathaniel was put to work at once in folding
papers and setting types. At Martinsburg he
used to ride post, with tin horn and saddle-bags,
delivering papers to scattered subscribers in the
thinly settled country. N. P. Willis himself
served a year’s apprenticeship at his father’s
press in Boston, in an interval of his schooling;
and in his letters home from England alluded
triumphantly to his having once been destined
by his parents to the trade of a printer. His
particular duty was to ink the types. “We remember
<em>balling</em> an edition of ‘Watts’s Psalms
and Hymns,’ and there are lines in that good
book that, to this day, go to the tune we played
with the ink-balls, while conning them over.”
A sketch of the old office of the “Potomac
Guardian,” made by “Porte Crayon,” is in the
possession of Mr. Richard Storrs Willis of Detroit.</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen young Nathaniel returned
to Boston and entered the office of his father’s
old paper, the “Independent Chronicle,” working
in the same press-room in Court Street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
where his father had once worked, and the great
Franklin before him. He also found time, while
in Boston, to drill with the “Fusiliers.” In
1803, invited by a Maine congressman and
other gentlemen of the Republican party, he
went to Portland and established the “Eastern
Argus” in opposition to the Federalists. Here
the subject of this biography was born three
years later. “Well do I remember that day,”
his father wrote to him fifty-seven years after
the event, “and the driving snow-storm in which
I had to go, in an open sleigh, to bring in the
nurse from the country. Francis Douglas
boarded with us at that time. He was a very
pleasant young man, and had a half promise (if
it was a boy) it should be called <em>Francis</em>. But
your mother soon overruled that, and decided
that you should have both of our names, for fear
she should never have another son! You was a
fine fat baby, with a face as round as an apple.”</p>

<p>Party spirit ran high at this time, and political
articles were acrimonious. Libel suits were
brought against the publisher of the “Argus,”
which involved him in trouble and expense; and
six years after its establishment it was sold for
four thousand dollars to the same Francis Douglas
who had come so near imposing his Christian
name on the infant Willis. At Portland
Nathaniel Willis came under the ministrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and influence of the Rev. Edward Payson, D. D.,&mdash;on
whose death, many years after, his son
composed some rather perfunctory verses,&mdash;and
began henceforth to devote himself to the cause
of religion. From 1810 to 1812 he sought to
establish a religious newspaper in Portland, but
met with no substantial encouragement. At the
latter date he returned to Boston, where, after
years of effort, during which he supported himself
by publishing tracts and devotional books,
he started, in January, 1816, the “Boston Recorder,”
which he asserted to be the first religious
newspaper in the world. It was in this
periodical that the earliest lispings of Willis’s
muse reached the ear of the public. The “Recorder”
was conducted by his father down to
1844, in which year it was sold to the Rev.
Martin Moore. It still lives as the “Congregationalist
and Boston Recorder.”</p>

<p>Nathaniel Willis also originated the idea of
a religious paper for children. “The Youth’s
Companion,” which he commenced in 1827 and
edited for about thirty years, was the first, and
remains one of the best, publications of the kind
in existence. In a letter to his son he gave the
following account of its inception: “He was in
the habit of teaching his children, statedly, the
Assembly’s Catechism, and to encourage them to
commit to memory the answers, he rewarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
them by telling them stories from Scripture history
without giving names. The result was that
the Catechism was all committed to memory by
the children, and the idea occurred of a children’s
department in the ‘Recorder.’ This department
being much sought for by children, it
suggested the experiment of having a paper exclusively
for children.” Around the fireplace
where Mr. Willis sat with his children were
some old-fashioned Dutch tiles, representing
scenes from the New Testament, and it was in
answer to their questions about these that he
began his narrations. One sees in this little
domestic picture the beginnings of the young
Nathaniel’s literary training and the germ of his
“Scripture Sketches.” Years after, a college lad,
when shaping into smooth blank verse the story
of the widow of Nain or the healing of Jairus’s
daughter, his memory must have gone back to
their rude figures about his father’s hearth,
seeming to move and stir in the flickering light
of the wood fire; and the recollection of his
father’s voice and the listening group of brothers
and sisters gave tenderness to the strain.</p>

<p>He was only six when the family removed
from Portland to Boston, and he appears to have
kept little remembrance of his birthplace. The
noble harbor, with its islands, which were the
Hesperides of Longfellow’s boyish dreams, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
old fort on the hill, the mystery of the ships,
the Spanish sailors with bearded lips, the noise
of the sea fight far away, and the faces of the
dead captains as they lay in their coffins, did
not enter into Willis’s experience. Indeed, the
period of childhood, which has been to many
poets so fruitful in precious memories, seems to
have left few deep traces on his mind, if we
except its religious impressions. The life of
his father’s household, though rich in domestic
affections, was probably not stimulating to
the imagination. It was the life of a Puritan
home, of what is called in England a “serious
family,”&mdash;that life which oppresses Matthew
Arnold with its <i lang="fr">ennui</i>; its interests divided between
“business and Bethels;” its round of long
family devotions, strict Sabbath observances,
catechisms, and visiting missionaries. Dancing,
card-playing, and theatre-going were, of course,
forbidden pleasures. The elder Willis, though
a thoroughly good man and good father, was a
rather wooden person. His youth and early
manhood had been full of hardship; his education
was scanty, and he had the formal and narrow
piety of the new evangelicals of that day,
revolting against the latitudinarianism of the
Boston churches. He was for twenty years
deacon of Park Street Church, profanely nicknamed
by the Unitarians “Brimstone Corner.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
“My recollection of a particular occasion,” says
an old member of that society, “when, at a conference
meeting in the church, he, as presider,
was expounding John xv., is that I regarded it
as a memorable illustration of a man’s attempting
to expound without ideas. I hear him saying,&mdash;more
than fifty years ago,&mdash;‘v. 4. Abide
in me. Abide is to dwell,’ in a most monotonous
tone, and the rest in the same manner of appreciation.”
His rigidity was, perhaps, more in his
principles than in his character, and his austerity
was tempered by two qualities which have
not seldom been found to consist with the diaconate,
namely, a sense of humor&mdash;“dry,” of
course, to the correct degree&mdash;and an admiration
for pretty women, or, in the dialect of that
day, for “female loveliness.” These tastes he
bequeathed to his son, as also a certain tenacity
of will, which, latent throughout the latter’s career,
came to the surface in an astonishing way
during the trials of his last years. This trait is
amusingly illustrated in the senior Willis’s correspondence
with his son by his allusions to an
interminable litigation that he was carrying on
in his eighty-fourth year. “I should have written
you sooner,” he says, “but that Irishman,
Garbrey, has sued me the <em>fourth</em> time about
that old drain which he dug up before my front
door, in Atkinson Street, that we never knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
before was there. He has lost his case in three
different courts, and now sends to the Supreme
Court a ‘Bill of Exceptions,’ which all my friends
think he cannot recover. It has been a great
trouble and expense to me. But I have carried
the case in prayer to God, constantly, and He
has three times defeated the extortioner.” Willis
always retained a cordial affection and respect
for his father, but between two such different
natures and divergent lives there could be little
genial sympathy or real intellectual intimacy.
The tough old deacon outlived the inheritor of
his name and calling by some three years, and
died May 26, 1870, at the age of ninety.</p>

<p>For his mother Willis cherished, as boy and
man, a devotion that may well be called passionate,
and which found utterance in many of his
most heartfelt poems, such as his “Birth-Day
Verses,” “Lines on Leaving Europe,” and “To
my Mother from the Apennines.” Her maiden
name was Hannah Parker. She was born at
Holliston, Massachusetts, and was two years
younger than her husband. She was a woman
whose strong character and fervent piety were
mingled with a playful affectionateness which
made her to her children the object of that perfect
love which casteth out fear. Like many
another poet’s mother,&mdash;like Goethe’s, for example,&mdash;she
supplied to her son those elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of gayety and softness which were wanting in
the stiffer composition of the father:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Von Mutterchen die Fröhnatur,</div>
<div class="verse">Die Lust zu fabuliren.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He inherited from her the emotional, impulsive
part of his nature as well as his physical constitution,
his light complexion, full face, and tendency,
in youth, to a plethoric habit. “My
veins,” he wrote, “are teeming with the quicksilver
spirit which my mother gave me. Whatever
I accomplish must be gained by ardor, and
not by patience.” She was his confidant, his
sympathizer, his elder sister. The testimony to
her worth and her sweetness is universal. The
Rev. Dr. Storrs of Braintree, in an obituary
notice written on her death, in 1844, at the age
of sixty-two, spoke of her as “the light and joy
of every circle in which she moved; the idol of
her family; the faithful companion, the tender
mother, the affectionate sister, the fast and assiduous
friend.”</p>

<p>Willis was the second in a family of nine
children, all of whom reached maturity, and two
of whom, besides himself, achieved literary reputation.
These were Sarah Payson Willis, afterwards
famous, under the <i lang="fr">nom de plume</i> of
“Fanny Fern,” as a prolific and successful
writer for children, and Richard Storrs Willis,
his youngest brother, formerly editor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
“Musical World,” the author of “Our Church
Music,” and known both as a musical composer
and a poet. Julia Willis, his favorite sister and
constant correspondent, was also a woman of
remarkable talent, with a gift of tongues and a
sounder scholarship than her more showy brother.
She wrote many of the book reviews in the
“Home Journal,” but always declined to renounce
her anonymity.</p>

<p>Such were the influences which surrounded
Willis’s early years. And if, at the first touch
of the world, the youthful members of the household
flew off like the dry seeds of the <i>Impatiens</i>,
it need not therefore be hastily concluded that
the home training, though perhaps too repressive
and severe, was without lasting effect for
good. Among the children and grandchildren
of Nathaniel Willis are Catholics, Episcopalians,
Unitarians, and representatives of other shades
of belief and unbelief. But this is the history
of many a New England Puritan family, and
such are the disintegrating forces of American
life. In the case of the eldest brother, it may
be affirmed that, from a career which was certainly
worldly, and in some of its aspects by no
means edifying, the light that shone from his
mother’s face uplifted in prayer for him never
altogether faded away.</p>

<p>Willis began school life under the tuition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the Rev. Dr. McFarland, of Concord, New
Hampshire. “I have forgotten every circumstance,”
he wrote long after, “of a year or two
that I was at school at Concord, New Hampshire,
when a boy, except the natural scenery of
the place. The faces of my teacher and my
playmates have long ago faded from my memory,
while I remember the rocks and eddies of
the Merrimac, the forms of the trees on the
meadow opposite the town, and every bend of
the river’s current.” Later he was brought
home and sent to the Boston Latin School, then
under “its well-remembered Pythagoras, Ben
Gould.” A few reminiscences of his slate-and-satchel
days are scattered here and there
through his writings. Thus he vaguely recalled
Ralph Waldo Emerson as “one of the boys
whose fathers were Unitarians,” and he was
greatly impressed by Edward Everett, then a
young Harvard professor, whose stylishly dressed
figure used to appear occasionally in Atkinson
Street, at No. 31, in which thoroughfare the
Willises dwelt. He remembered “the rousings
before daylight,” on May-day, “to go to Dorchester
Heights, and the shivering search after
never found green leaves and flowers; the buttoning
up of boy-jacket to keep out the cold
wind, and pulling out of penknife to cut off the
bare stems of the sweet-brier in search of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
hidden odor of the belated bud.” In “The
Pharisee and the Barber,” one of the two or
three stories of Willis whose scenes are laid in
Boston, the description of Sheafe Lane is evidently
from the life. The Pharisee of that tale,
Mr. Flint, an “active member of a church famed
for its zeal,” who “dressed in black, as all religious
men must (in Boston),” was doubtless a
sketch from memory of some pious familiar of
his father’s house, whose black eyes and formal
talk left upon the lad a mixed impression of awe
and distrust.</p>

<p>Harvard was the natural destination of a
Boston Latin School boy intending college. But
the line between the Orthodox and the Unitarians
was drawn more sharply in 1820 than in
1884. Even now stray youths from Boston are
found at other colleges than Harvard, attracted
elsewhere by family ties or theological affinities.
But at that time the cleavage made by the
schism in Eastern Massachusetts was still raw,
and Deacon Willis would almost as soon have
sent his boy into the jaws of hell as into such
a hot-bed of Unitarianism as the Cambridge
college.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Larry’s father,” wrote Willis in “The Lunatic’s
Skate,” “was a disciple of the great Channing, and
mine a Trinitarian of uncommon zeal; and the two institutions
of Yale and Harvard were in the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
most eminent men of either persuasion, and few are
the minds that could resist a four years’ ordeal in
either. A student was as certain to come forth a
Unitarian from one as a Calvinist from the other;
and in the New England States these two sects are
bitterly hostile. So to the glittering atmosphere of
Channing and Everett went poor Larry, lonely and
dispirited; and I was committed to the sincere zealots
of Connecticut, some two hundred miles off, to
learn Latin and Greek, if it pleased Heaven, but the
mysteries of ‘election and free grace,’ whether or no.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of the two great fitting-schools founded by
Samuel and John Phillips respectively at Andover
and at Exeter, the latter had been captured
by the Unitarians. But the Andover
academy, under the sheltering wing of the
famed theological seminary in the same town,
though barely thirty miles from Boston, remained
an insoluble lump of Calvinism, a
wedge of defiant Orthodoxy <i lang="la">in partibus infidelium</i>.
To Andover, accordingly, young Willis
was sent, after a course in the Latin School, to
complete his preparation for Yale. The academy
was then under the headship of that sound
classical master, John Adams, who was principal
from 1810 to 1833. It gave an excellent
fit in the classics, insomuch that Willis, though
the reverse of diligent in college, was carried
along a good way, with little study, by the impetus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
acquired at Andover. At Andover, too,
he began to give signs of literary tastes and in
particular to scribble verses, which had already
given him the reputation of a poet among his
fellows before he came up to college. A letter
dated July 3, 1823, and addressed to his elder
sister Lucy, about a fortnight before her marriage,
incloses a copy of verses which is perhaps
the earliest poem of Willis now extant. It has
no merit, but as containing hints of his later
manner and the unformed germs of that smooth,
diffuse blank verse in which his “Scripture
Sketches” were written, the opening lines may
be not without interest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There was a bride, and she was beautiful</div>
<div class="verse">And fond, affectionate; her soul did love.</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas not the transient feeling of an hour,</div>
<div class="verse">That loves and hates, and loves and hates again,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, no; it was a purer, kindlier feeling,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">A something rooted, grafted on the soul,</div>
<div class="verse">That cannot help but live and bud and blossom.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He also began to wreak thought upon expression
in that common vent to the <i lang="la">cacoethes scribendi</i>,
of young writers,&mdash;keeping a diary, “a red morocco
volume, of very ornate slenderness and
thinness, in which I recorded my raptures at
spring mornings and blue sashes, my unappreciated
sensibilities, my mysterious emotions by
moonlight, and the charms of the incognita
whom I ran against at the corner. This precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
record shared in the final and glorious conflagration
of Latin themes, grammars, graduses,
and old shirts, on leaving academy for college.”</p>

<p>“The Lunatic’s Skate” opens with some reminiscences
of school life at Andover:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the days when I carried a satchel on the
banks of the Shawsheen (a river whose half-lovely,
half-wild scenery is tied like a silver thread about my
heart), Larry Wynn and myself were the farthest
boarders from school, in a solitary farmhouse on the
edge of a lake of some miles square, called by the undignified
title of Pomp’s Pond. An old negro, who
was believed by the boys to have come over with
Christopher Columbus, was the only other human being
within anything like a neighborhood of the lake
(it took its name from him), and the only approaches
to its waters, girded in as it was by an almost impenetrable
forest, were the path through old Pomp’s
clearing and that by our own door. Out of school
Larry and I were inseparable. We built wigwams
together in the woods, had our tomahawks made in
the same fashion, united our property in fox-traps,
and played Indians with perfect contentment in each
other’s approbation.”</p>

</div>

<p>One of his school-fellows here was Isaac McLellan,
who afterwards became a contributor to
Willis’s “American Monthly.” He published
a long poem, “The Fall of the Indian,” which
Willis reviewed in the same periodical, referring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to the poet as “the very boy that has tracked
the woods with us, and called us by our nickname
over a hedge, and cracked nuts with us
by the fire in the winter evenings. Which of
us dreamed, as we read in our blotted classic,
‘Quam sit magnum dare aliquid in manus hominum,’
that he should ever be guilty of a book?
How it would have swelled our idle veins, as we
lay half asleep, bobbing our lines over the bank
of the Shawsheen on those long Saturday afternoons,
that we should ever play for each other
the gentle office of critic!”</p>

<p>In after years the rice fields of Georgia, with
their embankments and green surfaces, reminded
Willis of “the gooseberry pies which formed part
of my early education at Andover, and which
are among the warmest of my recollections of
that classic academy.” “We have fine times
picking berries here,” he wrote to his sister Julia.
“Every kind grows in profusion in Andover,&mdash;raspberries,
black, blue, thimble, and
whortle berries. The woods are crowded with
them. After tea we generally start, and after
we have eat enough go and bathe in the Shawsheen,
our Andover river.”</p>

<p>This Indian Ilyssus was the scene of an adventure
recorded in certain “Tête-à-tête Confessions”
in the “American Monthly,” doubtless
with some exaggerations for literary effect and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
with a <i lang="fr">dénoûment</i> suspiciously dramatic. The
passage may be given, however, for what it is
worth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Cytherean Venus! How I did love Miss Polly
D. Low, the pride of the factory on the romantic
Shawsheen! I saw her first in the tenderest twilight
of a Saturday evening, washing her feet in the
river. I was a lad of some impudence, and I sat
down on a stone beside her, and by the time it was
dark we were the best friends possible. She was beautiful.
I think so <em>now</em>. She was about eighteen, and,
though four years older than I, my education had
more than equalized us. At least, if not the wiser of
the two, I was the most skilled in the subtlety of love,
and practiced with great success <i lang="fr">les petites ruses</i>.
She was a tall brunette, and I sometimes fancied,
when her eye exhibited more than ordinary feeling,
that there was Indian blood under that dark and
glowing skin. The valley of the Shawsheen, just
below the village where I was at school, is a gem of
solitary and rich scenery, and the overhanging woods
and long meadows afforded the most picturesque and
desirable haunts for ramblers who did not care to be
met. There on Sunday afternoons, when she was
released from her shuttle and I from my Schrevelius,
did we meet and stroll till the nine o’clock bell of the
factory summoned her unwillingly home. I could
go without my supper in those days, though I doubt
if I would now on such slight occasion. By the time
vacation came, I found myself seriously in love, declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
my passion, and left her with my heart half
broken. We were gone four weeks, and when I returned
the butcher’s boy was engaged to Miss Low,
and I was warned to avoid the factory at the peril of
a flogging.”</p>

</div>

<p>In his last year at Andover Willis experienced
religion and joined the church. Any one who
has witnessed one of those spiritual epidemics,
called “revivals,” in some school or college needs
no description of the kind of pressure brought
to bear on the thoughtless but easily excited
young consciences there assembled. At the first
rumor of an unwonted “seriousness” abroad,
occasioned perhaps by the death of a fellow-student,
by a general sickness, or the depression
of gloomy weather in a winter term, the
machinery is set in motion. Daily prayer-meetings
are held, in which the elders play part,&mdash;the
movement at Andover was taken in hand by
the “Seminarians,” that is, the students of the
Divinity School;&mdash;the unregenerate are visited
in their rooms by classmates who are already
church members, and are prayed with and urged
to attend the meetings and submit themselves to
the outpourings of the Spirit. Under this kind
of stimulus there follows a great awakening.
Many are “under conviction,” the air becomes
electric, and there is a strange spiritual tension
which is felt even by the resisting. Momentous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
choices are made in an instant and under the
stress of contagious emotions. The awful issues
of eternity are set before a roomful of boys in
the midst of prayers and sobs and eloquent
words, exhorting the sinner not to let pass this
opportunity of salvation,&mdash;perhaps his last.
And then the movement subsides, leaving an impression
which endures with some, and with others
quickly wears off. Those who believe that
the Christian character and the Christian life
are the result of nurture and slow endeavor look
with distrust upon these sudden conversions.
The hardened sinner may need some such violent
call to repentance, but there is a sort of indecency
in this premature forcing open of the
simple and healthful heart of a boy, substituting
morbid self-questionings, exaggerated remorse,
and the terrors of perdition for his natural brave
outlook on a world of hope and enjoyment. The
story of Willis’s conversion is fully told in his
letters home, and it reads like a chapter of
“Doctor Johns.”</p>

<p>In 1821, being then fifteen years of age, he
had written to his father:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I can plainly see an answer to prayer in the delay
of my admission to the church. I prayed that
God would, if I was in danger of making a hasty
step, by some means or other prevent it. I doubted,
till it became almost a certainty, whether it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
proper. I doubted myself, my pretensions to a
change of heart; and my very heart seemed to sink
under me every time I thought of the solemn engagement
I was unhappy, extremely unhappy, when in
Boston, and have been, I might say, miserable ever
since.”</p>

</div>

<p>And again in 1822:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As to becoming a Christian, it is morally <em>beyond
my power</em>. I have not an objection against it that
would weigh a feather, and yet I feel no more solicitude
than I ever did about my eternal welfare.”</p>

</div>

<p>In a letter of the same year to his mother,
who had his conversion much at heart, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do have times when the tears of regret flow,
and I make the resolution of attending to the subject
of religion. But my light head and still lighter heart
dismisses the subject as soon as another object arrests
my attention, and my resolutions and regrets are
soon lost in the mazes of pleasure and folly.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is curious to reflect that these “mazes of
pleasure and folly” meant nothing more than
innocent school-boy diversions, such as black-berrying
and swimming parties, or at worst a
juvenile flirtation with some rural belle. The
oldness and gravity of the phrase, in contrast
with the boyish tone of other parts of his letters,
illustrate well that moral precocity&mdash;precocity
of the conscience as distinguished from the mind&mdash;developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in New England boys of the last
generation by the Puritan training.</p>

<p>In January, 1823, the great revival which had
been in progress at Boston struck the Andover
academy. Mr. Willis made his son a visit, and
urged him to join the church. After his return
to Boston he received the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Andover, Mass.</span>, <i>January 12, 1823</i>.<br />
<span class="right">Sunday afternoon.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>,&mdash;I received your package last
evening, with my Testament, etc., inclosed. As the
word of God I prize it, and as the gift of my affectionate
father I love it, and shall always look upon it
as a remembrance of an era in my feelings which I
hope I shall always be thankful for. You cannot imagine
how much your visit and advice strengthened
me in my resolutions, and spurred me forward in the
good work I had begun. I hope I have now the assurance
of being an heir of life and a recipient of the
protection which the wings of a Saviour’s mercy must
afford to those who are gathered under them. My
hope is sometimes shaken when I find my thoughts
wandering to other subjects while the ordinances of
God are administering before my eyes. But the moment
that I get upon my knees and pray for strength
I feel my assurance renewed, and rise happier and
happier from every renewal of my supplications.…
Saturday evening I attended our usual meeting in the
academy for the <em>first time</em> since I have been in Andover.
It is conducted by the pious scholars of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
academy in succession, and is very interesting. This
evening Dr. Shedd preached the lecture, and after
meeting there is to be another at Mr. Adams’s house.
So you see, pa, we are engaged here, and have reason
to hope that <em>many</em> will be inquiring the way to the
foot of the cross.…&mdash;<i>Nine o’clock.</i> I have been
to meeting at the chapel, and after that attended a
prayer-meeting at Mr. Adams’s. They were both
very solemn. Louis Dwight led the last.&mdash;<i>Monday
evening, 12 o’clock.</i> I have truly spent an evening
of happiness, and I thought I must open my letter
and tell you. At half-past six William Adams and
I had appointed a meeting, to be conducted wholly by
ourselves. We had invited only a few, but when we
got there it was so crowded that I could scarcely
make my way through the room to the Bible-stand.
I believe nearly all our unconverted brethren were
there.… After it was dismissed, many seemed to
linger, as if they did not want to go, and we conversed
with some of them. I then went into Cutler’s
room, and Allen and I stayed there till almost eleven
o’clock. There were several of the Seminarians there,
and we prayed and sung, <em>prayed and sung</em>, till it
seemed a little heaven on earth. The seriousness increases;
many more are deeply impressed, and the
academy presents solemn countenances generally. It
is late, and my eyes smart badly.</p>

<p class="center">Your affectionate son,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">N. P. Willis</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The William Adams here mentioned was a son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of the principal of the academy, and was afterwards
Willis’s classmate at Yale. Louis Dwight
was a theological student, who a year later was
married to Willis’s second sister, Louisa. The
subsequent progress of the revival is related in
the following letter, written two or three days
later:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="right"><span class="smcap">Andover, Mass.</span>, <i>January 15</i>.</span><br />
Wednesday evening, 12 o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Father</span>,&mdash;My heart is so overflowing
with joy and gratitude and happiness that I could
not rest till I had sat down and told you <em>all</em>. We
have had a meeting in Allen’s room to-night. Mr.
Styles was there, and talked so that I thought I could
almost see a halo round his head, and expected him
to turn into St. Paul come down again from heaven.
After meeting Mr. S. told them the meeting was
closed, but if any wished to converse with him or the
other professors of religion in the room, they might
tarry. The room was crowded, body and all, so that
you could not have got through, but no one stirred.
Sobbing and weeping was heard all round the room.
William Adams, Allen, Styles, and I then went round
and conversed with them. They all burst into tears
immediately, and listened with the greatest eagerness,
and when I got up to go to the next one, they held
on to me as though salvation depended on my talking
with them. <em>Isaac Stuart</em> sobbed aloud the whole
meeting time. <em>Joseph Jenkins was in tears</em>, and
came down to my room after meeting and asked me
to pray for and with him. He said he <em>could not</em> pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
himself; he <em>dared</em> not. I gave him the best advice
I could and prayed with him, and he is now in his
room, as I <em>hope praying for himself</em>. I talked with
little Joshua Huntingdon, and told him about his
father. He wept, and promised to go home and pray.
J. C. Alvord, a member of my class and a <em>fine fellow</em>,
was in the greatest misery. He could not sit upon
his chair, and took me out of the meeting to go to my
room and pray with him. Jno. Tappan of Boston
was very deeply affected. I conversed with Darrach
of Philadelphia, Carter of Virginia, King of Convers,
and several others. They all seemed to feel very
deeply, and all begged me earnestly to pray for them.
We could not get them away. They stood round
weeping and looking for some one to say something
to them. Oh, my dear father, what <em>can</em> we render to
God for all his mercies! Allen has been down in my
room several times to pray for some <em>particular one</em>.
There were so many to pray for that we have been
on our knees from seven o’clock till now almost all
the time. Kennett, my room-mate, is very much affected.
He fears to delay repentance, but says his
father won’t like it when he goes back to Russia, and
that there are no Christians in Russia.… Prayer ascends
continually, sinners are repenting, and I am as
proud as Lucifer. I feel as if I was going to do all
myself; as if I could convert a thousand without God,
if I only told them the truth. Oh, pray that I may
have humility! It is and must be the burden of my
supplications.</p>

<p>Of the names mentioned in this letter, that of
Isaac Stuart is not unknown to fame. Joseph
Jenkins afterwards became Willis’s brother-in-law,
marrying his sister Mary in 1831. He was
from Boston, and was graduated at Yale the
year after Willis.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
1823-1827.<br />
<span class="smaller">COLLEGE LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>In the fall of 1823, Willis entered Yale.
Commencement was then held in September
and first term opened late in October. College
life left a more enduring impress upon Willis
than upon almost any other American writer.
It furnished him with a fund of literary material.
It brought him into the sunshine, and
changed the homely school-boy chrysalis into a
butterfly of uncommon splendor and spread of
wing. During freshman year he lodged in the
family of Mr. Townsend, opposite South College,
with other members of the Andover contingent.
One of these was Henry Durant, who
was Willis’s chum all through the four years
of the course. He was a serious-minded lad,
a hard student, who took high rank in the appointment
list, and his influence over his less
steady room-mate was always for good. He
became in time the founder and first president
of the University of California, and a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of wide influence in educational and religious
matters on the Pacific coast. Among Willis’s
other intimates in his own class were Joseph
H. Towne, also a Boston boy, and afterwards a
doctor of divinity; and “Bob” Richards, of
New York, who took him home with him in
vacations, and introduced him to the gayeties
of the metropolis. Class lines were not drawn
very sharply then, and one of his best friends
in college was George J. Pumpelly of Owego,
New York. Their friendship was continued
or resumed in later life, when Willis bought
from Pumpelly the little domain of Glenmary;
and settled in his neighborhood on Owego
Creek.</p>

<p>Next after Willis himself, the most distinguished
member of the class of 1827 was Horace
Bushnell. In senior year the two roomed
in the same hall&mdash;the north entry of North
College; and in 1848, on the occasion of Bushnell’s
preaching a sermon at Boston to the Unitarians,
which excited much public comment,
Willis gave some reminiscences of his quondam
classmate in the “Home Journal,” telling, among
other things, how Bushnell once came into his
room and taught him how to hone a razor. He
described him as a “black-haired, earnest-eyed,
sturdy, carelessly dressed, athletic, and independent
good fellow, popular in spite of being both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
blunt and exemplary.” Bushnell was a leader
in his class; Willis decidedly not. They belonged
to different sets, and there was little in
common between the elegant young poet and
ladies’ man and the rough, strong farmer lad
from the Litchfield hills. They met once more
in after years,&mdash;in 1845, on the Rhine, both in
pursuit of health.</p>

<p>Henry Wikoff of Philadelphia&mdash;afterwards,
with the titular embellishment of “Chevalier,”
a familiar, not to say flamboyant, figure in several
European capitals, and the winner of fame
at home as the importer of Fanny Elssler and
founder of the “New York Republic”&mdash;happened
to be in New Haven during the summer
of 1827. He was preparing to enter college,
which he did with the class of ’31, but was
prematurely graduated by reason of sundry
irregularities. In his amusing “Reminiscences
of an Idler,” published in 1880, he gave the following
description of two undergraduates with
whom he was subsequently more nearly associated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I also remember two men who graduated in the
class of 1827, that were frequently pointed out to
me as its most conspicuous members. One was the
son of a very prominent statesman, which, in fact, explained
the notice he attracted; but there was enough
of individuality about John Van Buren to command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
attention. He had already revealed the traits which
distinguished him in after life,&mdash;easy and careless
in manner, bold in character, and of an aggressive
turn of mind. His rival in notoriety had no hereditary
claims to support him, but he was gifted with
a rare poetical talent that had already secured him
distinction both in and out of college. His tone and
bearing were aristocratic, not unmixed with <i lang="fr">hauteur</i>,
and though admired for his abilities he never commanded
the sympathies of his comrades. Such was
N. P. Willis, and such he remained to the end of his
life. Neither of these graduates, if I remember,
bore off ‘honors;’ but Willis was requested by his
class, with the approval of the faculty, to deliver a
poem at the Commencement of 1827. I was too
young to approach these Titans, as I regarded them,
and was content to gaze on them with deference as
they swept by me in the street. In after years I
became intimate with them both.”</p>

</div>

<p>The genial chevalier’s memory misled him
slightly in placing “Prince John,” as he was
called, in the same class with Willis. He was
a member of ’28, which he joined in junior
year, and like Willis was a great wit and a
great beau. These three contemporaries, senior,
junior, and sub-freshman, were strangely
juggled together again by Time, the conjurer.
They met in the famous Forrest trial, where
Van Buren figured as the defendant’s counsel,
and Willis as a <i lang="la">particeps criminis</i> and witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
for the plaintiff. Wikoff, who had known Forrest
intimately before and after his marriage,
and had traveled extensively with him in Russia
and elsewhere, was at first made a party in
the actor’s charges against his wife, but his
name was withdrawn from the case before it
came to trial.</p>

<p>Yale was then under the mild government of
President Day. Silliman, Knight, Kingsley,
Fitch, and Goodrich were among the professors,
and among the tutors were Theodore Woolsey
and Edward Beecher. The last afterwards sustained
another relation to Willis, as pastor of
Park Street Church. Student life in the twenties
was a much simpler existence than it is in
the eighties. That network of interests which
makes the college world of to-day such a stirring
microcosm,&mdash;with its athletic and social
clubs, its regattas, promenade concerts, and
class-day gayeties, its undergraduate newspapers
and magazines, and its lavish expenditure
upon society halls, boat-houses, ball-grounds, etc.,&mdash;was
all undreamed of. Far from owning a
yacht or a dog-cart, the Yalensian of those days
seldom owned a carpet or a paper-hanging.
When those unwonted luxuries were introduced
into his room by Freshman Wikoff, the rumor
of this offense against the unwritten sumptuary
laws of the college reached the ear of Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Silliman. He visited the apartment, and after
inspecting it gravely said, with a frown, to its
abashed occupant, “All this love of externals,
young man, argues indifference to the more
necessary furniture of the brain, which is your
spiritual business here.” The time-honored
paragraph in the catalogue on “necessary expenses”
gave the annual maximum as two hundred
dollars. That paragraph has always been
oversanguine, but probably four or five hundred
a year was the average cost of a college
education in 1825. During each of his last
two years Willis spent about six hundred. Life
in college was not only plain, but decidedly
rough. It was the era of “Bully Clubs,” town
and gown rows, “Bread and Butter Rebellions,”
etc. It was the thing to paint the
president’s horse red, white, and blue, and to
put a cow in the belfry. In 1824 a mob threatened
the Medical School because a body had
been dug up by resurrectionists. The Southerners,
then a large element at Yale, were particularly
wild and turbulent. Christmas, which
the Puritan college refused to make a holiday
of, was their recognized Saturnalia.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The day,” wrote Willis in a freshman letter to
his father, “is the greatest of the year at the South,
and our Southern students seem disposed to be restless
under the restriction of a lesson on playday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
There were many of them drunk last evening, and
still more to-day. Christmas has always been, ever
since the establishment of the college, emphatically a
<em>day of tricks</em>: windows broken, bell-rope cut, freshmen
squirted, and every imaginable scene of dissipation
acted out in full. Last night they barred the
entry doors of the South College, to exclude the government,
and then illuminated the building. This
morning the recitation-room doors were locked and
the key stolen, and we were obliged to knock down
the doors to get in; and then we were not much
better off, for the lamps were full of water and the
wicks gone. However, we procured others, and
went on with the lesson.”</p>

</div>

<p>Wikoff tells of a fight in a college room, in
which a dirk was used, between a South Carolina
student named Albert Smith and another
Southerner, which resulted in the expulsion of
both. Smith, who stood at the head of his class,
afterwards changed his name to Rhett, and became
a member of his state’s legislature, but
died prematurely.</p>

<p>New Haven in 1823-27 was not the considerable
manufacturing city of to-day, but a rural
town with a population of about nine thousand.
West of the college yard only two streets were
laid out. Beyond these, along the Derby turnpike,
stretched a level of sandy pastures, alive
with grasshoppers, where the young orators,
practicing for debates in “Linonia” or “Brothers,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
or for declamations before the Professor
of Rhetoric, used to go to “explode the elements.”
Down by the bay, in a region now
occupied by great factories, stood the old “Pavilion,”
a famous seaside hotel much resorted
to by Southern families. The first railroad
from New Haven was laid in 1839. As yet
even the Farmington Canal was only projected.
Willis and the Boston contingent used to come
all the way by stage-coach, passing through
Framingham, Worcester, and Hartford,&mdash;in
which last he had acquaintances, with whom he
sometimes spent a day <i lang="fr">en route</i>. Anthracite
coal was not in use in New Haven before 1827.
Citizens and students alike depended on wood,
the latter buying theirs at the regular wood-stand
near South College, and having it <em>cut</em> in
the yard behind the colleges, wood-saws not
being in general vogue. The habits of the collegians,
from a hygienic point of view, were
usually bad. They sat up late drinking strong
coffee in their rooms, rose very early perforce,
prayed and recited on an empty stomach, and
took little regular exercise. Dyspepsia was naturally
rife.</p>

<p>But <i lang="fr">en revanche</i> New Haven was a beautiful
little city, with a homogeneous population and a
charming society, and better fitted in some respects
for the seat of a university than it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to-day. It was already, thanks to the public
spirit of Governor Hillhouse, the City of Elms;
and it is hard to walk through Temple Street of
a moonlight evening without a regretful recollection
of Willis’s “Rosa Matilda description,” in
“Edith Linsey,” of a place that must have
been all Temple Streets,&mdash;a dream-city of
shaded squares and white&mdash;piazzaed mansions
shining among cool green gardens. In “The
Cherokee’s Threat” he has recorded his first
eager impressions of the new community that
he was entering, as he stood and looked about
him in the side aisle of the old chapel on the
opening day of the term: “It was the only
republic I have ever known,&mdash;that class of
freshmen. It was a fair arena.… Of the
feelings that stir the heart in our youth,&mdash;of
the few, the <em>very</em> few, that have no recoil and
leave no repentance,&mdash;this leaping from the
starting post of mind, this first spread of the
encouraged wing in the free heaven of thought
and knowledge, is recorded in my own slender
experience as the most joyous and the most unmingled.”</p>

<p>This was in the retrospect. He did not employ
such fine language in 1823. His first letters
from college are like those of any other
freshman, simple in style, filled with affectionate
messages to the folks at home, thanks for bundles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
etc., received, requests to mother touching
shirts and suspenders, and details of his daily
routine. They describe the prayers at early
candlelight and the meals in Commons Hall,
with its twenty long tables, its big dumb-waiter,
and its too abstemious tutor, who, from the vantage-ground
of a raised platform, returns thanks
when the dinner is only half done. “You may
sit down afterwards <em>if you wish</em>, but it is not
generally the case. There is an old woman who
has been in the college kitchen twenty years,
and in all this time done nothing but make pies.
We have them Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays;
the worst of it is we can only get one
piece. I have fared rather better than the rest
generally, for Durant seldom eats pie, and most
always sends me his piece.” Then there was the
round of study and recitation: Livy in the morning,
mathematics at eleven, and Roman antiquities
at four. “At recitation I have one of the
descendants of the Dutch settlers in New York
on each side of me. Their ancestors are mentioned
by Knickerbocker in his history of New
York.” These were doubtless Cortlandt Van
Rensselaer of Albany, and Washington Van
Zandt from Long Island. Between study hours
there is foot-ball on the green in front of the
colleges, “which game is not generally very edifying
to the shins of the freshmen.” These last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
have subscribed twenty-five cents apiece “to
support the lamps in the entry,”&mdash;a venerable
trick of the sophomores, who “collected in this
way five or six dollars, and had a scrape upon
it, and the conclusion of the matter was their
getting so intoxicated as to be unable to reach
home.” The freshmen have likewise had their
windows broken, and Willis’s chum has been
smoked out, during the former’s absence from
his room, by cigars inserted in the keyhole. A
somewhat distant and impersonal form of the
persecution this will seem to modern freshmen.
But Sophomore Kneeland, from Georgia, having
been collared by Tutor Stoddard, red-handed,
in the act of breaking windows, and having
knocked down the tutor and run, has been publicly
expelled, the president reading out his mittimus
in chapel to the whole college. Willis
has joined the Linonian Society,&mdash;“Calhoun, the
candidate for the presidency, was once a member
of it” (an ancient “campaign” argument);
also a freshman debating club, the officers of
which “are almost all professors of religion,”
and in which he has been chosen, in his absence,
“critic on composition and speaking.”
He has drunk tea at Miss Dunning’s. He has
called upon Mrs. Daggett and Mrs. T. Dwight,
finding the former of these two ladies to be “a
very pious woman, and a woman of uncommon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
understanding,” and the latter “a woman of
noble mind, though plain in person.” He has
taken a walk to the Cave of the Regicides on
West Rock,&mdash;time out of mind the goal of the
freshman’s first pilgrimage. He has been appointed
one of the committee to solicit subscriptions
in his own class for the Greeks, and is
also one of the managers of the Bible Society,
and active at the Friday evening prayer-meetings,
there being just at present considerable
“engagedness” among “professors” in the several
classes. Meanwhile Tutor Twining has been
hissed and scraped at while conducting services
in chapel. The government “are growing more
and more rigorous. Almost every member of
the freshman class is called up and questioned.
Many are dismissed, and an examination is made
of everything, from the stealing of a sugar-bowl
out of the hall to the prostration of a tutor.
Tutor Woolsey was smoked the other evening
by two fellows who were too drunk to make
their escape, and were caught without any difficulty.
They did it at twelve o’clock at night,
wrapped in sheets, and are both dismissed.” The
disturbances between the sophomores and freshmen
culminated for Willis in a short suspension
in the winter of 1823-24 for honorably refusing
to disclose the names of sophomores by whom
he had been smoked and squirted, or the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of persons in whose rooms he had seen a squirt,&mdash;an
instrument of torture whose possession
involved expulsion. The letter in which he announced
his suspension is very long and filled
with heroic sentiments.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All my friends have been to see me, and justify
me in my conduct. There are two professors of religion
in the sophomore class who have done exactly
so, and will be treated accordingly. And though it
is a matter of policy with the government to pursue
this course, it is said, and justly, that they despise an
informer. My meeting with this squirt was entirely
unavoidable, not originating (as perhaps you may
suppose) from being in company where I ought not
to be.”</p>

</div>

<p>Willis suffered frequently from homesickness
and low spirits during the winter of his freshman
year. He had the poetic temperament, and
was subject to his moods, easily elated and easily
depressed. His chum was away somewhere teaching,
and Willis, in his loneliness, had recourse
to his pen.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I find but few among the students,” he wrote to
his father, “whom I should choose as companions.
Most of them are profane and dissipated, and their
highest ambition seems to be to show off as a high
fellow, and one who can overreach the government
and laugh at its officers. The pious students in my
class are mostly <em>men</em>, without any refinement either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of manners or feeling,&mdash;fresh from the country,&mdash;whose
piety renders them respectable, and who without
it would be but boors. But there are a few students
who have both piety and refinement, and some
who, though not professors of religion, respect it, and
who are moral in their outward conduct, whatever be
the state of their hearts. These I can generally associate
with, but when they are <em>all</em> out of the way,
and I am in need of something to brighten my feelings,
I can find in the flow of fancy a forgetfulness
of the darker side. I have written a great deal in
this way since my college life commenced, and my
writing will <em>always</em> depend on the thermometer of
my feelings.”</p>

</div>

<p>As the youthful scribe gained readier power
of expression his home correspondence became
fuller and more effusive. He wrote with much
minuteness a narrative of an evening spent at a
country parsonage in West Haven, of a walk to
the light-house, a visit to the cave of the hermit
of East Rock, and of a trip by steamboat to
New York. He dwelt at length upon all the
impressions which the varying seasons and his
daily experiences made upon his mind. There
is, of course, no literary art in most of these
juvenile confidences. The language is apt to be
sophomorical, and the letters, as a whole, will
seldom repay quotation, but an extract may be
given here and there as a specimen of his epistolary
style. The following is from a letter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
July 11, 1824, to his sister Julia, with whom
he was always particularly unreserved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I wish you were here to walk with me these
beautiful moonlight evenings. I have seldom gone
to bed and left the mild Queen of the Night riding
in the heavens, for it seems a waste of noble feelings.
When I am walking on such evenings as we have
had this week past, and amidst such scenery as New
Haven presents, chastened and softened in its beauty
by the pure and quiet light of the moon, I have an
elevation of thought and sentiment which I cannot
drown in sleep without reluctance. I really think we
had better lay it down as a rule never to go to sleep
while the moon is shining. In fact, Julia, I suspect
(for I find no one who sympathizes with me in this
feeling) that I am something of a lunatic,&mdash;affected
by the rays of that beautiful planet with a kind of
happiness which is the result of a heated imagination,
and which is not felt by the generality of the common-sense
people of the world. Last Friday evening, you
know, was beautiful. I attended a meeting of the
professors of religion, statedly held on that evening
in the theological chamber, and when it was out
went alone to walk. I strolled along upon the shore
of the bay towards the light-house a mile or more,
and never did I meet with so delightful a scene.
There was no wind stirring, or not enough to make a
ripple on the wave, and the hardly perceptible swell
of the tide cast its waters upon the pebbles without a
sound. You know the appearance of a bay when the
light is shed obliquely upon it&mdash;looking like one immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sheet of liquid silver, and if you have ever
seen a boat pass across it at such a moment, and seen
that beautiful phenomena of the phosphorus dripping
like fire from the oars and gilding the foam before
the prow, you can have some idea of the scene I then
witnessed. Now and then a sloop stole languidly
across the bay, hardly appearing to move, and presenting
an alternate light and shade as the moon
struck upon the flapping sail or the helmsman tacked
to take advantage of the hardly perceptible breeze
which swept him slowly from the land. I declare it
did seem like enchantment. The clock struck one,
but I felt no disposition to go home, and, as the air
was pure and balmy, the thought struck me that it
would be a pleasant hour to bathe. Accordingly I
undressed, and swam along the shore slowly for about
half a mile in the cool, refreshing waters, with sensations
which must be felt to be understood. After this
delightful exercise I walked home, and, seating myself
by the window where I could look at the moon,
fell asleep, and did not wake till near morning.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This fancy, that he was peculiarly affected by
the light of the moon, was the first suggestion
of his wild tale, “The Lunatic’s Skate,” one of
his most imaginative stories, and not unworthy
of comparison with the weird fictions of Edgar
Poe.</p>

<p>In the summer term of his sophomore year
Willis was again suspended for a few weeks,
this time in common with a majority of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
class and in consequence of what was known
as “the Conic Sections Rebellion.” The class
had been assured by the tutors that they would
not have to learn the corollaries to the propositions
in that branch of mathematics, and
when the objectionable corollaries were, notwithstanding,
imposed upon them, the mercury
then standing at 90° and the annual examinations
at hand, eighty-four members bound
themselves by a solemn pledge not to recite
them. The government were firm, and the
recalcitrant sophomores were suspended in platoons,
day after day. Horace Bushnell was a
ring-leader in this revolt, which included the
“professors” equally with the worldly. All the
suspended men were taken back at the end of
the term.</p>

<p>In some recollections of Willis by his classmate,
Hugh Blair Grigsby, published in the
latter’s journal, the “Norfolk Beacon,” in the
autumn of 1834, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first notice that the public had of his budding
genius was a little poem in six verses, the two
first lines of the first verse being,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘The leaf floats by upon the stream</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Unheeded in its silent way,’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We cannot recall the whole stanza; but our fair readers
may remember that their albums contained, some
time since, a beautiful vignette representing a lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
resting in her bower, listening to the notes of a
pretty songster perched above her. This engraving
was taken from these lines in this poem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘The bird that sings in lady’s bower,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To-morrow will she think of him?’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Grigsby says that this poem took the prize offered
by the “New York Mirror.” He also recalls
a division-room composition, of a humorous
character, read by Willis in the winter of
1824-25, about an old man planting a cabbage
on his wife’s grave, which produced great merriment
in the class. In the same year verses
signed “Roy,” mainly on scriptural subjects,
began to appear in the poet’s corner of the
“Boston Recorder,” where they jostled the selections
from Watts or original contributions
from the pens of “Maro,” “Eliza,” and “The
Green Mountain Bard.” Some of these <i lang="la">juvenilia</i>
were too imperfect to merit preserving,
and were never put between covers. Others,
like “Absalom,” “The Sacrifice of Abraham,”
and “The Burial of Arnold,” were among his
most successful things. They were widely quoted
and admired, copied about in the newspapers,
inserted in readers and collections of
verse, and have done as much to upbear his
memory as any of his later writings. They
were not all contributed to the “Recorder.”
Some came out in “The Christian Examiner,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
“The Memorial,” “The Connecticut Journal,”
“The Youth’s Companion,” and “The Telegraph.”
It was customary for the editors of
weekly and monthly periodicals, who ordinarily
paid their contributors nothing, to stimulate
Columbia’s infant muse by an annual burst of
generosity in the shape of a prize for the best
poem printed in their columns during the year,&mdash;a
device now relegated to the juvenile and
college press. Several of these honors fell to
Willis’s share. Lockwood, the publisher of an
annual gift-book, “The Album,” paid him fifty
dollars for a prize poem, and he got unknown
sums for his “Absalom,” “prize poem designated
by the judges of original poetry in the
‘Christian Watchman,’” as announced in the
issue of that paper for March 30, 1827; and
for “The Sacrifice of Abraham,” similarly designated
by the judges in the “Boston Recorder”
for 1826. He was also invited to write
for the “Atlantic Souvenir,” published in Philadelphia,
Goodrich’s “Token,” and Hill’s “Lyceum”
in Boston, Bryant’s new magazine in
New York, and a paper recently started in the
same city and edited by a brother of Professor
Silliman; for the “Bristol Reporter,” a “newspaper
in Rhode Island,” and other publications.</p>

<p>All this literary glory gave the young undergraduate
great <i lang="fr">éclat</i> in New Haven. He received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
many invitations out, and was teased for
verses by the owners of countless albums. He
began to frequent the society of the town, where
his rapidly developing social gifts soon made
him a favorite. He was at this time a tall,
handsome stripling, with an easy assurance of
manner and a good deal of the dandy in his
dress. His portrait, painted by Miss Stuart of
Boston, a daughter of the famous portrait-painter,
Gilbert Stuart, shows him with a rosy face,
very fair hair hanging in natural curls over the
forehead, a <i lang="fr">retroussé</i> nose, long upper lip, pale
gray eye with uncommonly full lid (a family
trait), and a confident and joyous expression.
He carried himself with an airy, jaunty grace,
and there was something particularly spirited
and <i lang="fr">vif</i> about the poise and movement of his
head,&mdash;a something which no portrait could
reproduce. With naturally elegant tastes, an
expansive temper, and an eagerness to see the
more brilliant side of life, Willis could at all
times make himself agreeable to those whom he
cared to please. But he was quick to feel the
chill of a hostile presence, and toward any one,
in especial, who seemed to disapprove of him he
could be curt and defiant. He had a winning
way with women, who were flattered by his recognition
of their influence over him and grateful
for <i lang="fr">les petits soins</i> which he never neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Taken up more and more with social distractions,
he ceased to apply himself to his college
duties. Indeed, he had never felt much interest
in the studies of the curriculum, excepting
Latin, for which he had a taste and in which
his scholarship was fairly good. Mathematics
was his pet aversion. He did considerable miscellaneous
reading, and cultivated a liking for
the old British dramatists and Commonwealth
prose writers, like Burton, Taylor, and Browne;
his studies in whom he afterwards imparted to
the readers of the “American Monthly.” He
wrote to his father, shortly before graduation,
that he had devoted his whole time in college
to literature.</p>

<p>Always more of a ladies’ man than a man’s
man, fastidious too in the choice of acquaintances,
he took small part in college affairs, and
preferred the social life of the town. He was
not a frequenter of Linonia, that forum whose
decay furnishes an annual theme for lamentation
to returning graduates at Commencement.
But once he debated that perennial question,
“Were the Crusades a Benefit to Europe?”
and once he composed a comedy, which was
acted in the society with applause, though not
without scandal. The following reminiscences
will find an echo in the breast of many an
alumnus who in his salad days has sparkled out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in some “Coffee Club” or “Studio,” or other
Ambrosial experiment of the kind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I sunk some pocket money in a blank book
on reading Wilson’s ‘Noctes.’ Celestial nights I
thought <em>we</em> had of it, at old black Stanley’s forbidden
oyster house in New Haven; and it struck me
it was robbery of posterity (no less!) not to record
the brilliant efflorescence of our conviviality. Regularly
on reaching my chambers (or as soon after
morning prayers as my head became pellucid), I attempted
to reduce to dialogue the wit of our Christopher
North, ‘Shepherd’ and ‘Tickler;’ but alas!
it became what may be called ‘productive labor.’
Either my memory did not serve me, or wit (I
shouldn’t be surprised) reads cold by repentant daylight.
It was heavy work, as reluctant as a college
exercise, and after using up for cigar-lighters the
short-lived ‘Noctes,’ I devoted the remainder of the
book to outlines of the antique (that is to say, of old
shoes), my passion just then being a collection of
French slippers from the prettiest feet in the known
world (‘known,’ to me).”</p>

<p>Among the uncollected “Recorder” verses is
a series of three divertingly Byronic performances,
“Misanthropic Hours,” from which it
would seem that the poet, in his junior year,
had a momentary attack of cynicism, produced
by his discovery of the soullessness of “woman.”
Most boys who tag lines have gone through this

<p>Meanwhile, rumors of his idleness and dissipation
began to reach Boston, and caused his
family much distress. These reports were absurdly
exaggerated, and were warmly denied by
his friends, who asserted that the head and front
of his offending were an occasional moonlight
drive to “the Lake” and a supper, with a glass
of ale at “Barney’s.” Willis was gay in college,
but very far from dissipated. In the select circles
where he was made at home nothing like
dissipation was tolerated. The society of the
little university town was as simple as it was refined.
He was cordially welcomed in such families
as the Whitings, the Bishops, the Hubbards,
and the entire Woolsey, Devereux, and Johnson
connection in New Haven, Stratford, and New
York. His winter holidays were spent partly
at New York with his classmates Rankin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Richards, partly at Stratford with the Johnsons,
once at New London among the kinsfolk of his
grandmother, Lucy Douglas; and once he traveled
as far as Philadelphia. His “dissipations”
in New Haven were picnics to East Rock, rehearsals
of “The Lady of the Lake” at a seminary
for young ladies, pie-banquets in Thanksgiving
week,&mdash;paid for with verses,&mdash;and New
Year’s calls with their accompaniments of a
cooky and a glass of wine.</p>

<p>That his head was a little turned by his literary
and social successes is not wonderful. He
had his share of vanity, and in his confidential
letters to his parents and sisters he made no effort
to conceal his elation. A passage from one
of these, dated January 7, 1827, will give a good
idea of his occupations and his frame of mind
at this point in his senior year:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I stayed in Stratford till Friday, and then the Johnsons
offered me a seat in the carriage to New York.
This, of course, was irresistible; and Friday night at
ten o’clock I was presented to the mayor of the city,
at a splendid levee. It was his last before leaving
his office, and I never saw such magnificence. The
fashion and beauty and talent of the city were all
there, crowding his immense rooms to show their respect
for his services.… I found many old acquaintances
there and made some new ones,&mdash;among
the latter, a Mrs. Brunson, as beautiful a woman as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
ever saw, and her sister, Miss Catherine Bailey, also
a most beautiful woman. I met the very accomplished
Adelaide Richards there, who patronized me
and played my dictionary, and from whose father
and mother I received an invitation to dine on New
Year’s day. At two or three o’clock I went <em>home</em> to
Mr. William Johnson’s (who married Miss Woolsey’s
sister), and in a glorious bed, with a good coal fire by
my side, slept off the fatigues of a sixty miles’ ride
and four hours’ dissipation.</p>

<p>“On Saturday evening I went to a genuine <i lang="fr">soirée</i> at
the great Dr. Hosack’s. This man is the most luxurious
liver in the city, and his house is a perfect palace.
You could not lay your hand on the wall for
costly paintings, and the furniture exceeds everything
I have seen. I met all the literary characters of the
day there, and Halleck, the poet, among them. With
him I became quite acquainted, and he is a most glorious
fellow. More of him when we meet.… You
know on New Year’s day in New York all the gentlemen
call on all their acquaintances. I began at
twelve o’clock at the Battery, and went up to St.
John’s Park, merely running in and right out again
till four, the dinner hour. I called on everybody.
William Woolsey went with me, and, by appointing
a rendezvous in every street, we kept along together.
At four I went to Mr. George Richards’s to dine.
He is no relative of Robert’s, and lives in the best
style in a large house on St. John’s Park. We sat
down to dinner between five and six, and sat several
hours with a very large party. I got a seat next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to the beautiful Miss Adelaide, and enjoyed it much.
They live in the French style, and the last course
was sugar-plums!”</p>

</div>

<p>In another letter he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was much flattered in vacation by the attentions
of literary men and women; the latter more particularly,
who seemed to consider it quite the thing to
find a poet who was not a bear, and who could stoop
so much from the <i lang="la">excelsa</i> of his profession as to dress
fashionably and pay compliments like a lawyer. I
heard of a very <em>blue</em> young lady who said, ‘La, how
I should love to see Mr. Willis! I am sure I should
fall in love with a man who writes such sweet poetry.’
She is both belle and bluestocking, they say.”</p>

</div>

<p>One of the families in which Willis was an
<i lang="fr">habitué</i> was the household of Mrs. Apthorp, a
widow with four lovely daughters, who conducted
one of the seminaries for young ladies for which
New Haven was famous. This was the original
of Mrs. Ilfrington’s school in “The Cherokee’s
Threat.” Willis was much ridiculed by the reviewers
for his very high-colored description of
this educational establishment, and in particular
for declaring that “in the united pictures of
Paul Veronese and Raphael” he had “scarcely
found so many lovely women, of so different
models and so perfect, as were assembled in my
sophomore year,” in this Connecticut “sugar-refinery.”
His lines “On the Death of a Young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Girl” were written on the occasion of the death
of one of this family, some years after. The
“Lines to Laura W&mdash;&mdash;, Two Years of Age”&mdash;one
of two selections from Willis in Emerson’s
“Parnassus”&mdash;were addressed to a little New
Haven girl, the sister and biographer of Theodore
Winthrop. Another friend of Willis’s was
a Mrs. De Forest, widow of the American consul
at Buenos Ayres, a lady of fortune, who came
to New Haven, and bought a house facing the
green, where she gave fashionable parties. She
was herself a beautiful woman, and her daughters,
Julia and Pastora&mdash;<i lang="la">matre pulchra filiæ
pulchriores</i>&mdash;were great belles among the students
in Chevalier Wikoff’s day, who describes
one of them as a “perfect blonde,” and the other
as a “matchless brunette.”</p>

<p>The religious impressions which had been
stamped upon Willis’s mind by the Andover revival
were gradually obliterated by the preoccupations
of undergraduate life. He did not definitely
renounce his profession, and remained till
graduation in communion with the college church.
But the state of his soul gave deep anxiety to his
good parents, who looked upon him, as he did
upon himself, as a backslider. In a letter to his
father during a season of “ingathering” in the
college, stimulated by the eloquent preaching of
Professor Fitch, he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My own experience makes me very much alive
to the frequent fallacy of the hopes which are experienced
in revivals. I understand your anxiety for me,
and I understand the feelings which prompted mother’s
most tender and affectionate addition to your
letter. If I perish it will not be because I do not
<em>know</em> my duty, for there are few who have been better
instructed. But my feelings are most peculiar
and most trying. I am under one ceaseless and enduring
conviction of sin; one wearing anxiety about
my soul, without making any visible progress. I
know what you will write about it. I could anticipate
every word you can say upon the point. But so
it is, and I have done with <em>all</em> discussion of it.”</p>

</div>

<p>At the completion of the senior examinations
Willis delivered the valedictory poem to his
class, “with a simplicity and feeling which
thrilled the audience,” says one who was present.
Portions of this were printed in his “Sketches”
and in subsequent editions of his poems. It is
one of the hardest things in the world to write
a good occasional poem, and Willis’s Class Day
address does not differ much from other performances
of the kind. It is in blank verse, laboriously
didactic, and expresses the usual conventional
sentiments and noble moral reflections
proper to the occasion. It is by no means as
good as another occasional poem of his, “The
Death of Arnold,” written upon the burial of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
class champion, and first printed in the “Connecticut
Journal.”</p>

<p>Willis spent the senior vacation&mdash;a halcyon
period of six weeks that formerly intervened
between Class Day and Commencement&mdash;in a
trip through New York State and Canada; taking
what is now known as the grand tour, and
gathering impressions which he ultimately
worked into the texture of his vivid sketches
of “Niagara, Lake Ontario, and the St. Lawrence.”
He traveled by the Erie Canal, then
newly opened through an almost unbroken wilderness,
dotted here and there with stripling
cities, Utica, Palmyra, Rochester,&mdash;the last
only a few years old.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The burnt stumps of the first settlers are all over
the town: you find them close by the doors and in
the yards of the people, and you may look between
elegant blocks of stone and brick buildings and see the
<em>natural forest</em> within five minutes’ walk. It is complete
mushroom. We saw Colonel Rochester, who
first settled it. He and his wife were sitting at their
front door, enjoying the evening under trees which
twelve years ago were the depth of the wilderness.”</p>

</div>

<p>There was a perpetual novelty in these contrasts.
He saw the country, as it were, in the
making. The canal-boat went only four miles
an hour, and the voyager could get out, when so
minded, to stretch his legs and pick the wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
flowers along the tow-path. Odd experiences relieved
the monotony of this quiet sail along the
amber Mohawk, “bonniest stream that ever
dimpled.” One Sunday, at the request of old
General Wadsworth of Geneseo, who happened
to be aboard and took a great fancy to Willis,
the latter preached a sermon to the passengers
assembled in the cabin, and passed among them,
in consequence, as a young minister who “had
geten him yet no benefice.” And here is a little
idyl perhaps worth recording:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On Sunday morning I saw a girl on a hillside in
the wildest part of the Mohawk Valley, milking. So
I leaped ashore, to the great amusement of the passengers,
and ran up to give her a lecture. She was
quite pretty, and blushed when I asked her if she
knew it was wicked to milk on Sunday. She had a
pretty little clean foot, probably washed by the wet
grass, and held up the milking-pail for me to drink
with considerable grace. I should have begged a
kiss if the boat had not been in sight. I have just
been called up to look at Palmyra. It is curious to
sail through the centre of a town, and see people in
the windows above you and on the steps of the
houses, crowding to see the strange faces on board.
They look so much at home and you come so near
them that you can hardly believe you shall be in ten
minutes in the depth of the forest again.”</p>

</div>

<p>At Utica he found a host of friends, was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
with Western hospitality, and had twenty
or thirty invitations to dinners and parties. A
Utica belle whom he had known in New Haven
made up a picnic in his behoof to Trenton Falls,
the scenery of which he described so admirably
in “Edith Linsey.” It was his hap to visit
Trenton on the very day when a Miss Suydam,
a young lady from New York, fell over the falls
and was killed. From Auburn he drove out on
a visit to another fair acquaintance, Miss Adele
Livingston, whose country house on Skaneateles
Lake he found to be a “little palace of cultivation
and refinement” dropped down unexpectedly
in the wilderness. This was “Fleming
Farm” in “Edith Linsey,” though it would
probably be a mistake to identify the heroine of
that tale with Willis’s hostess. With her he
took a horseback ride round the head of the lake,
and then he returned to his canal. At Niagara
he encountered a pleasant party of Boston and
Salem people, and was asked to attach himself to
their train on the way up Ontario and down the
St. Lawrence. Among them was a “Miss E.
M&mdash;&mdash;” (Emily Marshall?), a famous beauty,
who figures in Willis’s “Niagara” sketch in a
romantic and perilous adventure behind the fall.
“I am sorry I may not mention her name,” he
says, “for in more chivalrous times she would
have been a character of history. Everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
who has been in America, however, will know
whom I am describing.” At Montreal he fell
in with Chester Harding, the artist, with whom
he afterwards became intimate at Boston, and
who painted an excellent portrait of Willis, now
owned by Mr. Charles A. Dana. In September
he went back to New Haven to take his degree
and say good-by, and then college life was over
and the world before him.</p>

<p>Willis always looked back with tenderness to
his college days. Years after, in his “Slingsby”
papers, contributed to an English magazine, he
made New Haven and the university the scene
or background of some of his best stories and
sketches of American life, such as “Edith Linsey,”
“F. Smith,” “Scenes of Fear,” “Larks
in Vacation,” and “The Cherokee’s Threat.”
These, however, are not college stories in the common
meaning of the term. The heroes of these
amusing and often incredible adventures are undergraduates,
but they have the easy <i lang="fr">savoir faire</i>
of men of the world, and the incidents of the
narrative are mainly enacted outside the college
fence, and consist for the most part of love-making,
driving stanhope, and touring about the
country in an independent manner. The academic
life of the time offered but a meagre field
to the romancer, nor indeed is the case much altered
since. There have been loud calls, at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
subsiding, for an “American Tom Brown.”
A few patriotic Harvard graduates have responded,
but their success has been such that
the alumni of other colleges have congratulated
themselves that no one has been moved to perform
the same office for their own <i lang="la">Almæ Matres</i>.
It may be doubted whether the four years
of a college course are a broad enough base to
support a full-length novel. A man is not born
in college, and he seldom dies or marries there.
The struggle which decides his final success or
failure is fought on other fields. As to the life
itself, though engrossing enough to those who
lead it, as stuff for fiction it is scant,&mdash;a life of
pleasant monotony, varied by contests for honors
and prizes which seem paltry to the man, and
made exciting by that most fatuous of pursuits,
college “politics.” Nevertheless, it has unique
features of its own, peculiar developments of
sentiment and humor which appeal to the imagination.
To these, the man who has lived it and
found it sweet will often attempt to give shape,
as he looks back upon it in less happy years,
even though he may understand well enough that
such fragmentary experiences want the unity
and importance required in a continuous fiction.
As experiments of this nature, Willis’s college
stories should be regarded. It must be confessed
that he idealized a good deal. His geese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
were always swans, and he practiced an airy exaggeration
provoking to the statistician or the
literal minded. He speaks, for example, in an
off-hand way of “the thousand students of the
university,” though the number never reached
half a thousand at any time when he was a student.
But in the incidental glimpses of the life
which he described, in the atmosphere which he
flung around it, he was true to the spirit of that
life,&mdash;the gay, irresponsible existence of half-idle,
half-earnest youth, whose friendships are
warm and unquestioning, to whom the world is
new, the future full of promise, and every girl a
Venus. There is a glamour over it all&mdash;“the
golden exhalations of the dawn”&mdash;and romance
is the proper medium in which to present it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Bright as seems to me this seat of my Alma
Mater, however,” wrote Willis in “Edith Linsey,”
“and gayly as I describe it, it is to me a picture of
memory, glazed and put away; if I see it ever again
it will be but to walk through its embowered streets
by a midnight moon. It is vain and heartbreaking to
go back after absence to any spot of earth, of which
the interest was the human love whose home and
cradle it had been. There is nothing on earth so
mournful and unavailing, as to return to the scenes
which are unchanged, and look to return to ourselves
and others as we were when we thus knew them.”</p>

</div>

<p>On leaving college, Willis signalized his entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
upon a literary career of forty years by
collecting and publishing a score of his juvenile
poems, in a thin volume entitled “Sketches,”
and dedicated to his father. It contained, among
other things, four of the scriptural pieces which
had done more than anything else to give him
reputation. This vein he continued to cultivate,
and added others in later volumes till they reached
the number of eighteen. Even in his last years
he wrote one more scriptural poem for the “New
York Ledger,” at the persuasion of the enterprising
Mr. Bonner, reinforced by the proffer of
a hundred dollars. As there is little difference
in value between the earliest and latest of these,
it may be well to speak of them here collectively.
It is not hard to explain the vogue
which they obtained, or the reason why many
people at this day, who know nothing else of
Willis, have read his Scripture poems. One still
encounters, here and there, a good old country
lady who reads little poetry, but who can quote
from “Absalom” or “Jephthah’s Daughter”
and thinks them quite the best product of the
American Parnassus. They made good Sunday
reading. They appealed to an intensely biblical
and not very literary constituency; to a public
familiar with the Old and New Testaments
alike, and familiarized also with the life and
scenery of the East through Bible commentaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and the lectures of missionaries who had traveled
in Palestine. They were pleased to meet
again the most striking episodes and affecting
situations in the sacred narratives, set forth in
easy verse, embroidered prettily, and with the
sentiments and reflections proper to the subject
all duly marshaled before them. It lent concreteness
to the story to learn that in the room
of Jairus’s daughter,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“The spice lamps in the alabaster urns</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or that the Shunamite’s little son, on his way to
the field, passed</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">“Through the light green hollows where the lambs</div>
<div class="verse">Go for the tender grass;”</div>

<p class="noindent">or that the scene of Christ’s baptism</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">“Was a green spot in the wilderness</div>
<div class="verse">Touched by the river Jordan. The dark pine</div>
<div class="verse">Never had dropped its tassels on the moss</div>
<div class="verse">Tufting the leaning bank, nor on the grass</div>
<div class="verse">Of the broad circle stretching evenly</div>
<div class="verse">To the straight larches had a heavier foot</div>
<div class="verse">Than the wild heron’s trodden. Softly in</div>
<div class="verse">Through a long aisle of willows, dim and cool,</div>
<div class="verse">Stole the clear waters with their muffled feet,</div>
<div class="verse">And, hushing as they spread into the light,</div>
<div class="verse">Circled the edges of the pebbled tank</div>
<div class="verse">Slowly, then rippled through the woods away.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For the merely literary quality of these poems,
independent of their sacred associations, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
very much can be said. They were certainly
remarkably mature work for a college boy, pure
in taste, delicate and correct in execution. But
there is a slightly hollow ring to them, as of
verse exercises on set themes. The inspiration
is at second hand, from books and not from life.
As other juvenile poets have gone to their classics
for a subject, Willis went to his Bible. He
drank at Siloa’s fount instead of Helicon, and
tuned the psaltery instead of the lyre. We have
evidently not reached the real Willis yet. In
general the experiment of paraphrasing the narrative
portions of the Scriptures has not been
successful. Something is lost when the impressive
simplicity of the original is blown out into
wordy and sentimental verse. This process of
spinning rhetorical commonplaces from brief
texts is well illustrated in the following passage
from “Lazarus and Mary:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent9">“But to the mighty heart</div>
<div class="verse">That in Gethsemane sweat drops of blood,</div>
<div class="verse">Taking for us the cup that might not pass&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The heart whose breaking chord upon the cross</div>
<div class="verse">Made the earth tremble and the sun afraid</div>
<div class="verse">To look upon his agony&mdash;the heart</div>
<div class="verse">Of a lost world’s Redeemer&mdash;overflowed,</div>
<div class="verse">Touched by a mourner’s sorrow! Jesus wept!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is what Lowell called “inspiration and water.”
Alfred de Vigny, a fine spirit and good
poet, has tried the same thing in French and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
succeeded little, if at all, better than the Yankee
collegian. The inadequacy of Willis’s Scripture
renderings is made more apparent by the fact
that his blank verse is not a good vehicle for
strong feeling. It is correct and flowing, sometimes
musical, but seldom energetic. It favored
his tendency to diffuseness and it often degenerates
into a kind of accentless <i lang="la">oratio soluta</i>,
which is only verse because it scans, and only
blank verse because it does not rhyme.</p>

<p>Upon the whole the most genuine expression
of Willis’s talent in this early volume was in the
piece entitled “Better Moments,” which remains
one of his best, because one of his most spontaneous
poems.</p>

<p>It makes one realize the startling growth of
the United States in the last fifty years, to remember
that Willis had already won a “national
reputation” by his poetry when he left
college. The air was much thinner then, American
literature much scantier, the population so
small and so comparatively homogeneous, that
the suffrages of a few hundreds of readers in
New York, Boston, New Haven, and Philadelphia,
and the praises of a few dozen journals
were enough to bestow fame. What undergraduate
nowadays, however clever or precocious,
could hope to make his voice heard beyond the
limits of the college yard?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>It remains only to mention that the presence
in New Haven of the two poets Percival and
Hillhouse, when Willis was a student there, was
not without influence on his literary development.
Percival went to West Point as Professor
of Chemistry in 1824 and did not come
back to New Haven until 1827, but Hillhouse
resided constantly at his beautiful home in the
outskirts of the city, “Sachem’s Wood.” His
Master’s Oration, “The Education of a Poet,”
and his Phi Beta Kappa poem, “The Judgment,”
had given him great fame in the university
as an orator and poet. “‘Hadad’ was published
in 1825,” wrote Willis, “during my second
year in college, and to me it was the opening
of a new heaven of imagination. The leading
characters possessed me for months, and the
bright, clear, harmonious language was, for a
long time, constantly in my ears.” Of its author
he said, “In no part of the world have I seen a
man of more distinguished mien.… Though
my acquaintance with him was slight, he confided
to me, in a casual conversation, the plan of
a series of dramas, different from all he had attempted,
upon which he designed to work with
the first mood and leisure he could command.”</p>

1827-1831.<br />
<span class="smaller">BOSTON AND THE AMERICAN MONTHLY.</span></h2>

<p>The profession of letters was Willis’s manifest
destiny. Family tradition, his inborn tastes
and talents, the course of his studies, and his
achievements hitherto, all pointed that way. Yet
in the then state of the American press it took
no small amount of self-confidence to decline a
paying profession and launch upon the uncertain
currents of literary life. His next four
years were spent in Boston and were years of
apprenticeship in his life-work as an editor and
journalist. He continued to write and publish
verses, but his hand was acquiring cunning,
through constant practice and frequent failure,
in the production of that light, brilliant prose
which made him the favorite periodical writer of
his day; and he was also learning how to conduct
a magazine. He still made occasional contributions
to the “Recorder”&mdash;among others
the New Year’s verses, then essential to every
well-regulated paper&mdash;for 1828 and 1829. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
his first editorial engagement was with Samuel
G. Goodrich, the well-known bookseller and publisher,
who had removed from Hartford to Boston
in 1826. One of the first books which he
had published in Boston was Willis’s “Sketches,”
and he now employed the author of it to edit
“The Legendary” for 1828 and “The Token”
for 1829. Goodrich was a fine example of Yankee
enterprise and versatility. He was one of
the pioneers of “the trade” in America, entering
the field at the same time with the Harpers.
Under the pen-name of “Peter Parley,” he
wrote or edited a long list of books for the
young, histories, travels, biographies, tales, works
of natural history, school text-books, etc. He
had himself some pretensions as a poet, by virtue
of “The Outcast and Other Poems,” 1841.
He was an extensive traveler, and he became in
1851 United States consul at Paris. It was
the fashion among a certain set in Boston to
abuse “Peter Parley” and laugh at his literary
claims. But he was a very successful publisher,
and in selecting his editorial assistants, he had a
keen eye for the kind of talent that takes, and
the kind of work that pays. In his interesting
“Recollections of a Lifetime” he gives contrasted
sketches of the two principal contributors
to his annuals&mdash;Willis and Hawthorne.
Goodrich’s perceptions were, perhaps, not of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
finest, but he was a shrewd observer of matters
within his ken, and his recollections of Willis
are worth repeating.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The most prominent writer for ‘The Token’ was
N. P. Willis. His articles were the most read, the
most admired, the most abused, and the most advantageous
to the work. In 1827 I published his volume
entitled ‘Sketches.’ It brought out quite a
shower of criticism, in which praise and blame were
about equally dispensed: at the same time the work
sold with a readiness quite unusual for a book of poetry
at that period. One thing is certain, everybody
thought Willis worth criticising. He has been, I suspect,
more written about than any other literary man
in our history. Some of the attacks upon him proceeded,
no doubt, from a conviction that he was a
man of extraordinary gifts and yet of extraordinary
affectations, and the lash was applied in kindness, as
that of a school-master to a loved pupil’s back. Some
of them were dictated by envy, for we have had no
other example of literary success so early, so general,
and so flattering. That Mr. Willis made mistakes in
literature and life, at the outset, may be admitted by
his best friends; for it must be remembered that before
he was five-and-twenty he was more read than
any other American poet of his time; and besides,
being possessed of an easy and captivating address,
he became the pet of society and especially of the
fairer portion of it. As to his personal character, I
need only say that, from the beginning, he has had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
larger circle of steadfast friends than almost any
man within my knowledge. It is curious to remark
that everything Willis wrote attracted immediate attention
and excited ready praise, while the productions
of Hawthorne were almost entirely unnoticed.
Willis was slender, his hair sunny and silken, his
cheek ruddy, his aspect cheerful and confident. He
met society with a ready and welcome hand and was
received readily and with welcome.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is needless to pursue the contrast which the
writer goes on to draw between Willis and the
other and greater Nathaniel, who was then “the
obscurest man of letters in America.” The publisher’s
sympathies were obviously with his more
lively and popular contributor, and he is puzzled
to understand why such articles as “Sights from
a Steeple,” “Sketches beneath an Umbrella,”
“The Wives of the Dead,” and “The Prophetic
Pictures,” should have “extorted hardly
a word of either praise or blame” when originally
published in “The Token,” while “now
universally acknowledged to be productions of
extraordinary depth, meaning, and power.” He
is inclined to attribute it to a “new sense” in a
portion of the reading world&mdash;obtained unluckily
too late to profit the publisher of “The Token”&mdash;“which
led them to study the mystical.”
To Goodrich’s personal description of Willis
may be added the following little portrait by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Dr. Holmes, who remembers him well, as he
looked during this Boston period.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He came very near being very handsome. He
was tall; his hair, of light brown color, waved in luxuriant
abundance, and his cheek was as rosy as if it
had been painted to show behind the footlights, and
he dressed with artistic elegance. He was something
between a remembrance of Count d’Orsay and an
anticipation of Oscar Wilde. There used to be in
the gallery of the Luxembourg a picture of Hippolytus
and Phædra, in which the beautiful young man,
who had kindled a passion in the heart of his wicked
stepmother, always reminded me of Willis.”</p>

</div>

<p>“The Legendary” described itself as consisting
of original pieces in prose and verse; tales,
ballads, and romances, chiefly illustrative of
American history, scenery, and manners. It
was designed as a periodical, but only two volumes
were issued, one in the early, and one in
the later part of 1828. “The work proved a
miserable failure,” said Goodrich, though numbering
among its contributors Mrs. Sigourney,
Miss Sedgwick, Halleck, Pierpont, Willis, Gaylord
Clark, George Lunt, Grenville Mellen,
and others less known to this generation. Willis
wrote the two prefaces and contributed half
a dozen poems of no importance, unless we except
“The Annoyer,” which had considerable
currency, and three prose papers, “Unwritten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Poetry,” “Unwritten Philosophy,” and “Leaves
from a Colleger’s Album.” These last were
very juvenile and he never reprinted them. The
first two were tales with a moral, one depicting
the restorative influences of nature on a heart
crushed by bereavement, the other describing a
scholarly recluse, who lived alone with nature
and his books, and finally educated and married
his landlady’s daughter. The story in both
instances is very slight, overladen with sentiment,
descriptive digressions, and philosophy,
that might better have stayed “unwritten.” In
short, they are tedious&mdash;which Willis in his
later work never was. “Unwritten Poetry”
included, however, a description of Trenton
Falls and a fine rhapsody about water which he
rehabilitated afterwards and incorporated with
“Edith Linsey.” Both of these had the honor&mdash;in
the then paucity of our literature&mdash;to
be selected by Mary Russell Mitford for her
“Stories of American Life by American Authors.”
“Leaves from a Colleger’s Album”
was a first experiment of another kind, a humorous
sketch of a trip on the Erie Canal,
utilizing the experiences of his senior vacation,
and, in particular, the incident of his reading
a sermon in the cabin of the canal boat on
Sunday. It contains, in the person of Job
Clark, the nucleus of Forbearance Smith in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
“Slingsby” papers&mdash;the nearest approach that
Willis ever made to the genuine creation of a
character. He was always thus economical of
his material, repeatedly working over the same
stuff into new shapes.</p>

<p>“The Token” belonged to the class of illustrated
publications known as Annuals. It was
the age of Annuals, Gift Books, Boudoir Books,
Books of Beauty, Flowers of Loveliness, and
Leaflets of Memory. The taste for these ornate
combinations of literature and art was imported
from England, where the Ackermans had
published “The Forget-Me-Not,” the earliest
specimen of the kind, in 1823. Carey &amp; Lea
of Philadelphia brought out the first American
Annual, “The Atlantic Souvenir,” for which
Willis had been asked to write, when in college,
and to which he actually did contribute a copy
of birthday verses, “I’m twenty-two&mdash;I’m
twenty-two,” in the volume for 1829. These
were written, he affirmed, “in a blank leaf
of a barber’s Testament, while waiting to be
shaved.” They were also inserted in the “London
Literary Souvenir” for the same year, by
Alaric A. Watts, a copious editor of Annuals,
whose middle initial was cruelly asserted by
Lockhart to stand for <em>Attila</em>. The rage for
Annuals soon became general and lasted for
about twenty years. Goodrich enumerates some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
forty of them, bearing such fantastic titles as
The Gem, The Opal, The Wreath, The Casket,
The Rose, The Amulet, The Keepsake, Pearls
of the West, Friendship’s Offering. And these
are probably not half the list. There were
religious Annuals, juvenile Annuals, oriental,
landscape, botanic Annuals. Most rummagers
among the upper shelves of an old library have
taken down two or three of them, blown the
dust from their gilt edges, ruffled the tissue
papers that veil “The Bride,” “The Nun,”
“The Sisters,” and “The Fair Penitent,” and
wondered in what age of the world these remarkable
“embellishments” and the still more
remarkable letterpress which they embellish
could have reflected American life. There is
a faded elegance about them, as of an old ball
dress: a faint aroma, as of withered roses,
breathes from the page. Those steel-engraved
beauties, languishing, simpering, insipid as fashion
plates, with high-arched marble brows, pearl
necklaces, and glossy ringlets&mdash;not a line in
their faces or a bone in their bodies: that
Highland Chieftain, that Young Buccaneer,
that Bandit’s Child, all in smoothest <i lang="it">mezzotint</i>,&mdash;what
kind of a world did they masquerade
in? It was a needlework world, a world in
which there was always moonlight on the lake
and twilight in the vale; where drooped the willow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and bloomed the eglantine, and jessamine
embowered the cot of the village maid; where
the lark warbled in the heavens and the nightingale
chanted in the grove ’neath the mouldering
ivy-mantled tower; where vesper chimes
and the echoes of the merry bugle-ugle-ugle
horn were borne upon the zephyr across the
yellow corn; where Isabella sang to the harp
(with her hair down) and the tinkling guitar of
the serenader under her balcony made response;
a world in which there were fairy isles, enchanted
grottoes, peris, gondolas, and gazelles.
All its pleasantly <i lang="it">rococo</i> landscape has vanished,
brushed rudely away by realism and a
“sincere” art and an “earnest” literature.</p>

<p>In these Gems and Albums, the gemmy and
albuminous illustrations alternated with romantic
tales of mediæval or eastern life and with
“Lines on Seeing&mdash;&mdash;,” or “Stanzas occasioned
by” something. “The May-Flowers of Life,”
for example, “suggested by the author’s having
found a branch of May in a volume of poems
which a friend had left there several years ago.”
In the Annual dialect a ship was a “bark,” a
bed was a “couch,” a window was a “casement,”
a shoe was a “sandal,” a boat was a “shallop,”
and a book was a “tome.” Certain properties
became gemmy by force of association, as sea-shells,
lattices, and Æolian harps. In England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
L. E. L. and in America Percival and Mrs.
Sigourney were perhaps the gemmiest poets.
But much of Willis’s poetry was album verse,
with an air of the boudoir and the ball-room
about it, a silky elegance and an exotic perfume
that smack of that very sentimental and artificial
school. This passage from “The Declaration”
is in point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“’Twas late and the gay company was gone,</div>
<div class="verse">And light lay soft on the deserted room</div>
<div class="verse">From alabaster vases, and a scent</div>
<div class="verse">Of orange leaves and sweet verbena came</div>
<div class="verse">From the unshuttered window on the air,</div>
<div class="verse">And the rich pictures, with their dark old tints,</div>
<div class="verse">Hung like a twilight landscape, and all things</div>
<div class="verse">Seemed hushed into a slumber. Isabelle,</div>
<div class="verse">The dark eyed, spiritual Isabelle,</div>
<div class="verse">Was leaning on her harp.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The Token,” begun in 1828 and continued
to 1842, was edited by Goodrich every year except
1829, when Willis had charge of it. Like
other Annuals it contained, in spots, some good
art and good writing. There were delicately
designed and engraved vignette titles or presentation
plates by Cheney, the Hartford artist.
There was an occasional contribution, in prose,
from Longfellow or Mrs. Child&mdash;then Miss
Francis, and likewise a contributor to “The Legendary.”
Many of Hawthorne’s “Twice-Told
Tales” came out in “The Token.” Mrs. Sigourney’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
“Connecticut River” divided with Willis’s
“The Soldier’s Widow” the $100 prize
offered by the publisher for 1828. Among the
contributors to Willis’s volume (1829) were
John Neal, Colonel William L. Stone, Mrs. Sigourney,
Mrs. Hale, the Rev. T. H. Gallaudet,
Willis’s Albany friend, J. B. Van Schaick, and
Goodrich himself. The Rev. G. W. Doane&mdash;afterward
Bishop Doane&mdash;gave his well known
verses, “What is that, Mother?” Willis gave
five poems of his own, the only noteworthy
one among which was “Saturday Afternoon,”
written to accompany the frontispiece, engraved
by Ellis from a painting by Fisher, and representing
children swinging in a barn. This had
more the character of a simple, popular ballad
than anything else which he had written, and
was liked by many readers who cared little
about his more elaborate verse. Another poem
in “The Token,” “Psyche before the Tribunal of
Venus,” he wrote for the engraving by Cheney
from a drawing of Fragonard. A college tale,
“The Ruse,” was a slight advance on the experiments
in “The Legendary;” the dialogue was
handled more freely, but the story was weak as
a whole, hardly worth mentioning, certainly not
worth preserving. Willis continued to contribute
verses to “The Token” after he had resigned
its editorship. “To a City Pigeon,” “On a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Picture of a Girl leading her Blind Mother
through the Woods,” and doubtless other pieces
were printed in subsequent numbers. He wrote
for other Annuals, at various times: “The
Power of an Injured Look,” for “The Gift,”
a Christmas book, 1845; an article “On
Dress,” for “The Opal,” 1848, and edited “The
Thought Blossom,” a memorial volume, as late
as 1854. “The Torn Hat” was contributed
to “The Youth’s Keepsake” for 1829, and
“Contemplation” was written in 1828 to accompany
an engraving in “Remember Me,” a
religious Annual published in Philadelphia. But
he had no very high opinion of the class of literature
that they cultivated, and spoke of them
as “yearly flotillas of trash.”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1829 he entered upon his
first serious venture as a journalist, by starting
the “American Monthly Magazine,” which
ran two years and a half&mdash;from April, 1829,
to August, 1831. Mr. Thomas Gold Appleton
describes Willis’s undertaking as “a slim
monthly, written chiefly by himself, but with the
true magazine flavor.” Appleton and his friend
Motley, then students in Harvard, were both
contributors. For a young <i lang="fr">littérateur</i>, only a
year and a half out of college, without capital,
without backing, almost without experience, the
establishment of a monthly magazine was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
an enterprise of some boldness. His
expectations, however, were modest enough, and
his preliminary card, “To the Public,” casts
some light on the conditions of literary journalism
at that time. He says that he cannot pay
much for contributions, like the English magazines
which he took for his model. “The difficulties
of transmission over such an immense
country and the comparatively small proportion
of literary readers limit our circulation to a
thousand or two, at the farthest.” He had,
moreover, “the ebb of a boyish reputation”
against him. Notwithstanding he launched upon
his voyage with excellent pluck and vigor. He
conducted his magazine with little assistance,
writing himself from thirty to forty pages of
printed matter every month in the shape of tales,
poems, essays, book reviews, and sketches of life
and travel. Boston was not yet the Boston of
Emerson, Longfellow, Lowell, and Holmes, but
it had already as fair a claim to the title of
literary metropolis as New York. Everett and
Channing were great names. Dana, Pierpont,
and Sprague were among its poets. These men
were not available for Willis’s purposes, but he
rallied to his support a number of younger men,
such as Richard Hildreth, the historian, George
Lunt, the poet, Park Benjamin, Isaac McLellan,
the Rev. George B. Cheever, Albert Pike,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
afterwards the Arkansas poet and fire-eater,
and Rufus Dawes,&mdash;then a budding genius,
subsequently a preacher of erratic doctrines,&mdash;J.
O. Rockwell, Mrs. Sigourney, and others
whose names have fallen silent. Next to the
editor’s own graceful work, the most notable
things given to the public through the columns
of the “American Monthly” were Pike’s
“Hymns to the Gods,” poems of a richly classical
inspiration, which have often provoked
comparison with Keats’s odes; and which, if
their workmanship were equal to their imaginative
fervor, would justify the comparison.</p>

<p>Willis led off in the opening number with
a carefully written, but not very characteristic,
essay on “Unwritten Music.” It was thought
monstrous fine by his friends, but suggests, it
must be confessed, that dreariest product of the
human mind,&mdash;a prize composition. As a
study of the harmonies of nature, it was much
too general in its reflections and descriptions to
please a modern taste, wonted to the sharp and
full detail of Thoreau and his successors. The
editorial articles, prose and verse, in the “American
Monthly” were too many to be mentioned
here individually. There were stories, “The
Fancy Ball,” “The Elopement,” “P. Calamus,
Esq.,” and others which their author never recognized
so far as to give them any place in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
collected writings. Others, as “Baron von Raffloff,”
“Captain Thompson,” “Incidents in the
Life of a Quiet Man,” etc., were the rough
drafts of later tales, such as “Pedlar Karl,”
“Larks in Vacation,” and “Scenes of Fear.”
“Albina M’Lush” was the best of these. “The
Death of the Gentle Usher” contained an eloquent
passage on the night heavens, which obtained
a better setting in “Edith Linsey.” “An
Inkling of Adventure” lent its name and nothing
else to the first published collection of Willis’s
“Slingsby” stories. Then there were
sketches of travel in New York State and Canada,
partly reminiscences of senior vacation and
partly memorials of holidays from the editorial
desk, spent at Saratoga, Lebanon Springs, or
elsewhere: “Notes upon a Ramble,” “Letters
of Horace Fritz, Esq.,” and “Pencillings by the
Way,”&mdash;a title afterward used to better advantage.
Parts of these were similarly refurbished
for later employment. The secret of that skillful
blending of gayety and sentiment, the quick,
light transitions, which make much of the charm
of Willis’s best stories and sketches, like “F.
Smith,” or “Pasquali,” he had not yet learned.
In these earlier efforts the serious parts drag
and the humorous parts are flashy and thin. Besides
the monthly “table” there were editorial
articles of that rambling, chatty description peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to the period, and which the “Noctes” had
done as much as anything to introduce: “Scribblings,”
“The Scrap Book,” “The Idle Man,”
“Tête-à-tête Confessions,” etc., in which the editor
takes the reader into his confidence and
his sanctum, makes him sit down in his red morocco
<i lang="fr">dormeuse</i>, reads him bits of verse from his
old scrap-books and his favorite authors, calls
attention to his japonica, his smoking pastille,
his scarlet South American trulian (a most familiar
bird with Willis&mdash;he gets it in again in
“Lady Ravelgold”), and his two dogs Ugolino
and L. E. L., whose lair is in the rejected MSS.
basket. He fosters an agreeable fiction that he
writes with a bottle of Rudesheimer and a plate
of olives at his elbow, and he says now and then
in a hospitable aside “Take another olive,” or
“Pass the Johannisbergh”; this to his imaginary
interlocutor, Cousin Florence, or Tom Lascelles,
or The Idle Man, an epicure and dandy,
“who eats in summer with an amber-handled
fork to keep his palm cool.”</p>

<p>These amiable coxcombries of Willis gave
dire offense to the critics, and especially to Joseph
T. Buckingham, the veteran of the Boston
press and editor of the “Courier,” then the
most influential Whig newspaper in Massachusetts.
He published epigrams on Willis, with
very blunt points, administered fatherly rebukes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to him for his affected English, and objected
strongly to Ugolino, L. E. L., and the trulian.
Willis retorted in kind, and a good-natured war
raged between the “Courier” and the “American
Monthly,” though their editors were privately
the best of friends. In his “Specimens
of Newspaper Literature,” Buckingham paid a
glowing and, indeed, extravagant compliment to
the talents of his young adversary. Willis’s experience
in editing the “American Monthly”
was of great advantage to him. He had a natural
instinct for journalism, and he soon acquired
by practice that personal, sympathetic attitude
toward his readers, and that ready adjustment
of himself to the public taste, which made him
the most popular magazinist of his day and defined
at once his success and his limitations.
For its purposes Willis’s crisp prose was admirable:
“delicate and brief like a white jacket,&mdash;transparent
like a lump of ice in champagne,&mdash;soft-tempered
like the sea-breeze at night.”
It had an easy, conversational grace, the air of
“the town,” the tone of good society. In his
review of Lady Morgan’s “Book of the Boudoir,”
he made a plea for that <i lang="fr">negligé</i> style
which he practiced so daintily himself. “We
love this rambling, familiar gossip. It is the
undress of the mind. There are few people
who possess the talent of graceful trifling, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in writing or conversation. Study may make
anything but this. It is like <i lang="fr">naïveté</i> in character,&mdash;nature
let alone.” There was a great
deal of good writing in Willis’s “American
Monthly” articles; bright thoughts expressed
in exquisite English, here and there a page
which Charles Lamb or Leigh Hunt might have
been glad to claim. Some of these he rescued
from the old files of the magazine and inserted
in his later work. The chapter on “Minute
Philosophies,” “A Morning in the Library,”
and “The Substance of a Diary of Sickness”
were used again in “Edith Linsey,” and a spirited
description of Nahant in one of the “tables”
did duty in “F. Smith.” But many a
nice bit was too small for resetting and remained
lost in the ephemeral context,&mdash;many such a
scrap as this little picture of summer in town:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Was ever such intense, unmitigated sunshine?
There is nothing on the hard, opaque sky but a mere
rag of a cloud, like a handkerchief on a tablet of
blue marble, and the edge of the shadow of that tall
chimney is as definite as a hair, and the young elm
that leans over the fence is copied in perfect and motionless
leaves like a very painting on the broad sidewalk.”</p>

</div>

<p>The “New England Galaxy,” which was also
under Buckingham’s management, was edited
for a time by one William Joseph Snelling, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
made quite a stir in Boston newspaper circles.
He had been an under-officer in the army and
stationed somewhere in the Northwest, but came
to Boston about 1830 and devoted himself to
sensational journalism and in particular to a
crusade against gamblers. His life was threatened
for this, and he converted his office into a
sort of arsenal. In 1831 he published a slashing
lampoon, “Truth: a New Year’s Gift for
Scribblers,” in which he blackguarded American
writers in general and paid his respects to Willis
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">Some of this delicate banter was exhumed and
quoted a few years later by Captain Marryat,
in the article in the “Metropolitan” which led
to the affair of honor between that warrior and
Willis. The latter answered Snelling “contemptuously
but effectively,” Goodrich reports,
“in some half dozen verses inserted in the ‘Statesman,’
and addressed to <em>Smelling</em> Joseph. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
lines stuck to poor Smelling for the remainder
of his life.” The pasquinader himself afterwards
went to New York and conducted a meat-axe
publication, “The Censor.” Goodrich adds,
that he “fell into habits of dissipation, which
led from one degradation to another, till his
miserable career was ended,”&mdash;a victim, no
doubt, to the angry muse. Willis also contrived
to offend Mrs. Lydia Maria Child by a satirical
review of her “Frugal Housewife” and by harping
on a sentence from that authority, “hard
ginger-bread is nice.” She took this very much
to heart, and when she afterwards had charge
of the literary department of the “Traveller”
showed an abiding hostility toward her whilom
critic. He early attained to the dignity of parody.
“The Annoyer” was travestied in the
“Amateur” and a humorous imitation of “Albina
M’Lush” was also printed. Mere literary criticism,
however unfair, need not greatly disturb
any one. But Willis was subjected, in Boston,
to personalities of a very annoying character.
He was constantly in receipt of anonymous letters
calling him a puppy, a rake, etc. He was
attacked in the newspapers for his frivolity, his
dandyism, and his conceit. Private scandal,
circulated by word of mouth, concerning his
debts and his alleged immoralities, sometimes
got into print. It would not be easy to explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
why so kind a man as Willis, one always so
eager to oblige and so prone to say good-natured
things about everybody, should have excited so
much wrath, not only at this time, but all
through his life, by his harmless literary fopperies
and foibles, did we not remember that he
was successful, that he was a favorite in society,
and, above all, that he wore conspicuously good
clothes. There was also something about his
airy way of writing and the personality it suggested
that was and is peculiarly exasperating
to a certain class of serious-minded people who
resent all attempts to entertain them on the part
of any one whom they cannot entirely respect.
Willis carried it off lightly enough, though, of
course, it must have stung him. He knew, he
said, “how easy it is to despise the ungentlemanly
critic and forget the poor wrong of his
criticism.”</p>

<p>In intervals of work on the “American Monthly”
he contributed frequently to the “Boston
Statesman,” having been engaged, together with
Lunt and Dawes, to write something for it every
week, “short or long, prose or verse,” at the
rate of five dollars an article, an arrangement
that lasted for some months. This seems now
beggarly pay, but Nathaniel Greene of the
“Statesman” was, according to Willis, the only
editor in the country who, as early as 1827, paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
anything at all for verse. During these early
years of journalistic life Willis sojourned awhile
in the pleasant land of Bohemia. He was a
member of a supper club, which included two
representatives of each profession. Washington
Allston and Chester Harding were the artists;
Willis and Dawes the men of letters; Horace
Mann and five or six more completed the tale.
Willis was a frequent lounger in Harding’s studio,
and some years after he was delighted to
come across his tracks at Gordon and Dalhousie
castles, where Harding was known. Willis was
fond of fast horses, and used to drive his friends
out to Nahant, for a spin on the hard beach
along the edge of the surf. This was the scene
of “F. Smith,” one of his most perfect and
characteristic stories. With Dawes and others
he resorted, not seldom, for a game supper, to
an ancient and once somewhat stately hostelry,
known as the “Stackpole House,” where the
wines were excellent and the landlord good-humored
and disposed to trust,&mdash;the original,
doubtless, of Gallagher in “The Female Ward,”
a story written long afterwards, but whose incidents
and descriptions are assignable to this
period.</p>

<p>Willis’s position in Boston was in some respects
a difficult one. His family connection
were plain, good folks, not “in society,”&mdash;not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
at least, in the literary society, which was Unitarian,
or in the so-called aristocratic society,
which was mainly either Unitarian or Episcopalian.
He himself was socially ambitious, and
these were the circles which he wished to frequent.
“The pale of Unitarianism,” he wrote,
“is the limit of gentility.” He was a great favorite
with Mrs. Harrison Gray Otis, the “lady
autocrat” and leader of the <i lang="fr">ton</i> in the Puritan
capital for many years. He was constantly at
her house when she was in town, and was invited
to be one of her party when she went to Saratoga
in the summer. Nor was this a passing
fancy with Mrs. Otis, but stood the test of time
and separation. She made him a long visit at
Idlewild during the latter years of his life. But
the Park Street Church people, among whom he
had been brought up, looked askance upon his
fashionable associations. The old stories of his
college dissipations were revived, while rumors
of his Boston irregularities reached the ears of
his New Haven acquaintances. Willis himself
took no notice of these slanders, but they were
warmly resented by his friends. His brother-in-law,
Joseph Jenkins, wrote to Mr. D. W. Whiting
of New Haven: “Nat is a good fellow. He
is not dissipated in any way; nor traveling the
Tartarean turnpike, as the good New Haven people
suppose. He is attending to his magazine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and doing his duty as well as any of us.”
Though Willis did not make the impression of
a man of very scrupulous morality, he was certainly
not given to any serious dissipations. It
was not in his temperament to run into physical
excesses. His senses were delicate, and he always
respected them. He never, for example,
used tobacco; he was never a hard drinker. In
youth he affected a moderate conviviality and
had an æsthetic liking for champagne. In middle
age he was accustomed to mix a little spirit
with his water, expressing a horror for the pure
element, on the whimsical ground that it tasted
of sinners ever since the flood. In this Boston
period, his offenses were probably limited to
running up bills at livery stables and inns, with
a too sanguine expectation of being able to pay
them from the proceeds of his literary work.
Edward Beecher, who had been a tutor at Yale
during his college course, was at this time pastor
of the Park Street Church. Finding himself
unwilling to conform his life to the strict rules
of that society, Willis called on Mr. Beecher
and stated the manner of his supposed conversion
in a revival at Andover, and the influences
that had induced him to join the church. He
said that he was sincere in the act, but was convinced
afterward that he was mistaken in his
conviction, and that he had not experienced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
change that qualified him for church membership;
and he requested Mr. Beecher to obtain
for him an honorable dismission. Mr. Beecher
sympathized with him in his feelings, and made
an effort to satisfy his request, but failed, as
the church then believed that there were but
three ways out of it, death, dismissal to another
church, or excommunication. Accordingly, at
a church meeting on April 29, 1829, in which
Mr. Beecher took no part, the following sentence
was passed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whereas certain charges have been made against
Brother N. P. Willis, which, in the opinion of this
church has been fully proved, namely: Absence from
the communion of this church and attendance at the
theatre as a spectator; and whereas he has neglected
to appear before the church to answer the said
charges, although duly notified; and has not given to
the church satisfactory evidence of penitence, but has
evinced by a letter laid before the church an entirely
different state of feeling; therefore voted, That Mr.
Nathaniel P. Willis be, and he hereby is, in the name
and by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, excommunicated
from this church.”</p>

</div>

<p>Deacon Willis was naturally grieved by this
turn of affairs, although he acquiesced silently
in the church’s decision. Theatre going, indeed,
was an offense against family, as well as church
discipline. Naturally, also, the object of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
<i lang="la">significavit</i> always afterwards thought and spoke
with some bitterness of “the charity of a sect
in religion.” He never renounced definitely his
Christian belief. He never became skeptical;
was not at any time, in fact, a thinker on such
themes and subject to the speculative doubts
which beset the thinker. He remained through
life easily impressible in his religious emotions.
“Worldling as I am,” he wrote many years after,
“and hardly as I dare claim any virtue as a
Christian, there is that within me which sin and
folly never reached or tainted.” But this ended
his connection with organized Christianity, and
he ceased for a long time to be a church-goer.</p>

<p>His position in Boston was also made painful
by an unsuccessful love affair. He had paid
court to Mary Benjamin, a woman of uncommon
beauty of person and graces of mind and character,
the sister of Park Benjamin and afterwards
the wife of the historian Motley. She
returned his feeling and the two were engaged
to be married, but the engagement was broken
through the determined opposition of the lady’s
guardian, Mr. Savage. Willis carried this thorn
in his side for years, and it gave him many
hours of bitter homesickness while abroad. In
a letter written a few days after landing in England,
in the summer of 1834, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“I loved Mary B., and never think of her without
emotion; but with all the world in France, Italy, and
England treating me like a son or a brother, I am not
coming home to fight my way to her through bitter
relatives and slander and opposition. They nearly
crushed me once, and I shall take care how they get
another opportunity. Still, after three years’ separation,
I think I never loved any one so well, and if
my way were not so hedged up, it would draw me
home now.”</p>

</div>

<p>To Mary Benjamin was addressed the lovely
little poem, “To M&mdash;&mdash;, from Abroad,” with its
motto from Metastasio,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“L’alma, quel che non ha, sogna et figura.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">By 1829 Willis had accumulated verses enough
to fill another slender volume of “Fugitive Poetry.”
Of the forty-three pieces in this, the
“Dedication Hymn,” written to be sung at the
consecration of the Hanover Street Church in
Boston, has the best title to remembrance. It
possesses a brief energy seldom attained by
Willis. As late as 1856, his old English friend,
Dr. William Beattie, wrote to him: “Your beautiful
‘Hymn’ was sung in one of our cathedral
towns, at the consecration of a new church, by an
overflowing congregation. Surely this is a fact
worth noting. Miss Rogers was the first who
told me of it, and often have I repeated ‘The
perfect world by Adam trod,’ etc.” “The Annoyer”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and “Saturday Afternoon” have been
already mentioned. “Contemplation”&mdash;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“They are all up, the innumerable stars”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">had the feeling, though not the artistic touch, of
Tennyson’s “St. Agnes,” and came near to being
a fine poem. There were five sonnets, one of
them&mdash;an acrostic to Emily Marshall&mdash;with a
good closing couplet,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Life in thy presence were a thing to keep,</div>
<div class="verse">Like a gay dreamer clinging to his sleep.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“A Portrait,” also, which Willis did not republish,
contained an effective passage, beginning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I go away like one who’s heard,</div>
<div class="verse">In some fine scene, the prompter’s word,” etc.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There were two more scriptural pieces, and the
remainder of the book was of no importance.
Many of its contents were written before those
of the earlier volume of “Sketches.”</p>

<p>The “American Monthly” proved a failure
financially, owing, doubtless, to a lack of the
right business management, for which Willis
had no faculty, and with which, in truth, he had
nothing to do. At the close of the summer of
1831 the magazine suspended publication, and
its editor, shaking off the dust of his feet against
the New England metropolis, fled to more genial
climes. He left behind him the squibs of his
brother journalists, the cackle of the tea-tables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and some $3,000 of debts incurred through the
failure of his enterprise. He never quite forgave
Boston. In a letter to his mother from England,
September 12, 1835, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They have denied me patronage, abused me, misrepresented
me, refused me both character and genius,
and I feel that I owe them nothing. I have never
suffered injustice except from my countrymen, and I
have in every other land found kindness and favor.
I would not write this for another human eye, but
you know how unjustly I have been treated, and can
understand the wound that rankles even in so light a
heart as mine. The mines of Golconda would not
tempt me to return and live in Boston.”</p>

</div>

<p>The “New York Mirror” of September 10,
1831, contained the following item: “We take
much pleasure in announcing to our readers that
the ‘American Monthly Magazine’ has been
united to the ‘New York Mirror,’ and that Nathaniel
P. Willis, Esq., will, from this period, be
an associate editor of the joint establishment.”
This announcement was followed in the next
week’s issue by “A Card to the Public,” in which
the new editor promises that, “having transferred
the only literary undertaking in which he has
any interest to the proprietor of the ‘Mirror,’
his whole time and attention will hereafter be
given to this work.” The “Mirrors” of September
10th and 17th published, furthermore, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
letters from Saratoga, written by Willis in August,
and containing some characteristic verses,
“The String that tied my Lady’s Shoe,” and
“To&mdash;&mdash;,”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“’Tis midnight deep: I came but now</div>
<div class="verse">From the bright air of lighted halls;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">as also a “Pencilling by the Way,” descriptive
of Providence and Brown University, where he
had just been delivering a Commencement poem.
On September 25th the editorial page for the
first time bore the heading, “Edited by George
P. Morris, Theodore S. Fay, and Nathaniel P.
Willis.”</p>

<p>The journal with which he had now connected
himself&mdash;and with whose successors, under different
names, he continued to be identified until
his death, thirty-six years later&mdash;was a weekly
paper, published on Saturdays, and “devoted
to literature and the fine arts.” It had been
founded in 1823 by Samuel Woodworth, author
of “The Old Oaken Bucket,” and General
George P. Morris, but Woodworth had withdrawn
some time before Willis joined it. Morris,
with whom Willis now began a business
partnership that lasted, with slight interruptions,
for the rest of their lives, and a personal friendship
almost romantic in its tenderness and fidelity,
was the most popular song writer of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
generation in America,&mdash;a sort of cis-Atlantic
Tom Moore, whose songs, adapted to the piano,
were on all the music-racks in the land. “Near
the Lake where droops the Willow” was a universal
favorite in the days of gem-book minstrelsy.
“My Mother’s Bible” was dear to the
great heart of the people, and the air of “Woodman,
spare that Tree” was heard by wandering
Americans ground out from every hurdy-gurdy
in the London streets. Unless a clever letter
in the “Mirror” of March 2, 1839, is wholly a
hoax, this last-mentioned song compared in popularity
with “Home Sweet Home,” having suffered
translation into French (“Bûcheron, épargne mon
arbre”), German (“Haue nicht die alte Eiche
nieder”), Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch; the
German version being even introduced by an
essay, “Ueber Morris’s Entwickelung, Denken
und Wirken.” “The Amaranth” for 1840, an
annual, edited by Nathaniel Brooks and dedicated
to Morris, contains Greek and Latin renderings
of his “Woodman,” as well as of Wilde’s
almost equally familiar and far better lyric, “My
Life is like the Summer Rose.” Morris was a
bustling, affable little man, with a shrewd, practical
side to him. He was a good business manager,
and as Willis had no talent in that kind, the
association was mutually advantageous. Morris’s
intellectual stature was not great, and Willis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
who loved the man, was unable to admire the
poet. He praised his songs in print, but there
was more of friendship than critical sincerity in
his praise. He had been in correspondence with
Morris before, and had contributed occasionally
to the “Mirror,” having sent it a poem in competition
for a twenty-dollar prize when he was
still in college. He now began to decant into its
columns a number of his “American Monthly”
articles, a circumstance which not only shows
how local the circulation of the latter must have
been, but sheds a curious light on the methods
of journalism at that epoch. The old “New
York Mirror” had a reputation for brightness
in its time and a circulation then considered
large, but as compared with the great magazines
of to-day it seems a very primitive affair, with
its “Original Essays,” its “Popular Moral
Tales,” “Desultory Selections,” and “Extracts
from an Unpublished Tragedy,” its poems “For
the ‘Mirror,’” by Isidora and Iolanthe, and its
solemn “Answers to Correspondents.” Now and
then there is a contribution of more pronounced
individuality, a poem by Halleck, a story by
Paulding or Fay. Theodore S. Fay, the other
editor, was a man of parts. He was the author
of several once popular novels, “The Countess
Ida” and “Hoboken,” <i lang="de">tendenz</i> romances against
dueling, “Ulric,” a poetical romance, and “Norman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Leslie,” which was afterwards dramatized,
and was founded on a famous murder trial in
which Burr and Hamilton had figured as counsel.
Fay contributed to the “Mirror” satirical
letters on New York society, “The Little Genius,”
and in 1832 published a volume of his “Mirror”
articles under the title of “Dreams and Reveries
of a Quiet Man.” In 1833 he went abroad, and
his letters from Europe, “The Minute Book,”
appeared in the paper side by side with Willis’s
“Pencillings.” He was appointed secretary of
legation at Berlin in 1837, and minister resident
at Berne in 1853. His novels have now gone
quite out of sight, but many of his short tales
are really very clever,&mdash;written in a rattling
style, with abrupt, jerky dialogues,&mdash;and may
be read even now without much effort. Another
name connected with the “Mirror” was that of
William Cox, an English printer employed upon
the paper, whose “Crayon Sketches by an Amateur,”
published in 1833, were highly commended
by Willis. He, too, was abroad during Willis’s
and Fay’s sojourn in Europe, and wrote letters
from England to the “Mirror,” whose foreign
correspondence was thus uncommonly varied.
The first thought of sending Willis abroad occurred
while the three editors were supping
together at Sandy Welsh’s oyster saloon. Long
and earnestly they revolved the question of ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and means. At length $500 were scraped together
as <i lang="la">viaticum</i>, and it was agreed that Willis
was to write weekly letters at ten dollars the
letter. The investment proved a good one both
for the “Mirror” and for its traveling editor.
With this slender capital in his pocket he embarked
at Philadelphia October 10th, the only
passenger on the merchant brig Pacific, bound
for Havre. He was young, sanguine, eager to
see life, but in his most hopeful mood he could
hardly have foreseen the dazzling experiences of
his next four years, or the far-reaching consequences
which the trip thus lightly undertaken
were to have for him.</p>

<p>Before sailing he had found time to visit Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Washington, and Mount
Vernon, and make a “Pencilling” of them for
the “Mirror.” Another letter gave his impressions
of New York, now become his American
address. He had also put to press the poem delivered
before the “Society of United Brothers,”
at Brown University, on September 6th, the day
before Commencement, together with a few other
pieces written since 1829. The dedication was
“To one of whom, in this moment of departure
for a foreign land, I think sadly and only&mdash;to
my mother.” The name-poem was one of those
conventional performances with which unlucky
recipients of invitations to “speak a piece” before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Phi Beta Kappas, United Brothers, or other
such academic bodies, are wont to dazzle the
young alumni. It was in blank verse, of course,
and dealt with the usual commonplaces about
ambition, content, the beauty of human love, and
the folly of skepticism and contempt. It showed
more maturity than the poem delivered before
his own Alma Mater four years before, but it
was much the same sort of thing. Of the remaining
contents of the book two were Scripture
sketches and four were of a more ambitious description
than Willis had previously attempted.
These were “Parrhasius,” “The Dying Alchemist,”
“The Scholar of Thebet Ben Chorat,” and
“The Wife’s Appeal” to her husband to “awake
to fame.” The theme of all these and the central
thought of this whole volume is the vanity
of an inordinate thirst for knowledge, power, or
fame. “Parrhasius,” the story of an old Olynthian
captive who was tortured to death by the
Athenian painter that he might catch the expression
of his last agony for his picture of
Prometheus, comes the nearest to success. Willis
had read the tale in Burton’s “Anatomy of
Melancholy.” “The Scholar of Thebet Ben
Chorat” was the story of a young Bedouin who
grew mad and died from too close application to
astrology, on which science Willis seems to have
crammed up for the nonce, if one may judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
from the profusion of his foot-notes. But in
truth these poems were little better than wax-work.
The sweet and natural lines, “To a City
Pigeon,” were worth all the rest of the book.</p>

<span class="smaller">LIFE ABROAD.</span></h2>

<p>Whatever may have been the effect of Willis’s
career in Europe upon his character, its
influence on his literary fortunes was most propitious.
Foreign travel furnished just the stimulus
that he wanted. As a writer he was at all
times very dependent on his supplies. If they
were fresh and abundant his writing was correspondingly
so; if life stagnated with him his
writing wore thin. Place is comparatively indifferent
to men of deep or intense genius, to a
philosopher like Emerson or a brooding idealist
like Hawthorne. They strike root anywhere, and
it is no great matter from what corner they look
forth upon the world. The life of the soul, the
life of nature, the problems of the conscience,
may be studied in Concord or Salem as well as
anywhere else. A profound insight, a subtle
imagination will interpret the humblest environment
into philosophy and poetry. And yet even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
these are not quite free of their surroundings.
To all but sworn Emersonians “English Traits”
is probably the most intelligible and satisfactory
of Emerson’s writings. “The Marble Faun” is
not Hawthorne’s greatest romance, but there is
a richness about it, a <em>body</em>, that comes simply
from its material, and is not to be found in
“The Scarlet Letter” or “The House of the
Seven Gables.”</p>

<p>As for Willis, his genius, such as it was, was
frankly external. His bright fancy played over
the surface of things. His curiosity and his
senses demanded gratification. He needed stir,
change, adventure. He was always turning his
own experiences to account, and the more crowded
his life was with impressions from outside, the
more vivid his page. He had the artist’s craving
for luxury, and was fond of quoting a saying
of Godwin: “A judicious and limited voluptuousness
is necessary to the cultivation of the
mind, to the polishing of the manners, to the
refining of the sentiment, and to the development
of the understanding.” This taste for the
sumptuous had been starved in Willis at home.
Not only were literature and society in America
far more provincial then than now, but life was
plainer in every way. The rapid growth of
wealth has obliterated the most striking contrasts
between cities like New York and Boston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
on the one hand, and cities like London and
Paris, on the other. In every foreign capital
nowadays one finds his simple republican compatriots
grumbling at the absence of American
conveniences, cursing the steamboats, the railway
carriages, the hotels, the luggage system,
the portable baths and bed-room candles, and
proclaiming loudly that the Americans are the
most luxurious people on the face of the earth.
In Europe, and especially in England, circumstances
threw Willis into a new world. He
shared for a time in the life of the titled aristocracy
and the idle rich, and he took to it like one
to the manner born. He was at home at once
amid all that gay ease and leisure. The London
clubs, the parks, the great country houses,
Almack’s and the Row, the beautiful haughty
women, the grace, indolence, and refinement,
hereditary for generations, seemed no more than
the birthright of this New England printer’s
son, from which some envious fairy had hitherto
shut him out.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have now and then a fit of low spirits,” he says,
in a letter from Marseilles, April 28, 1832, “though
generally the excessive excitement of new scenes and
constant interest occupies me quite. It is like an intoxication
to travel in Europe. I feel no annoyance,
grumble at no imposition, am never out of temper.
Fatigue is the only thing that bears me down. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
want leisure and money. I shall come back, I think,
to America after my engagement with Morris is over,
and marry and come out again. As to settling down
for these ten years, I cannot think of it without a
sickness at my heart. I wish to heaven I could keep
a journal and publish after I got home. This writing
and sending off unrevised is the worst thing in
the world for one’s reputation. However, I see a
world of things that I cannot put into letters, and I
feel every day that my mind is ripening and laying
up material which I could get nowhere else. You
can have no idea of the stirring, vivid habit one’s
mind gets into abroad. Living at home forever would
never be of half the use to me.”</p>

</div>

<p>Willis arrived at Havre November 3d, and
went on by diligence to Paris, where he spent
between five and six months. He had taken out
with him a number of good letters, some from
Martin Van Buren among the rest. The American
colony in Paris was then small and select.
It was under the wing of Lafayette, who was
very polite to Willis during his stay. Cooper
was there and his <i lang="fr">protégé</i>, Horatio Greenough,
the sculptor, who had come from Florence to
execute a bust of Lafayette. Morse, the artist,
too, who, on his return trip to America in a
Havre packet, in the year following, was to hit
upon his invention of the electric telegraph.
And lastly, Willis’s fellow-townsman, Dr. Howe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
then a zealous young philanthropist, who had
won much glory by his recent campaign in
Greece, and was now attending medical lectures
at the French capital. Willis took lodgings
with Howe until the latter, having been appointed
president of the American committee
for the relief of the Poles, went off on his dangerous
mission of distributing supplies among
the insurgent bands in Polish Prussia, an enterprise
which ended in his capture and confinement
for six weeks in a Prussian prison. All
these gentlemen Willis had the good fortune to
meet in familiar and cordial intercourse. Cooper
asked him to breakfast with Morse and Howe,
and walked and talked with him in the gardens
of the Tuileries. The acquaintance thus pleasantly
begun between the two authors was afterwards
renewed at home, though, from accidents
of geography, they never became really intimate.</p>

<p>Willis also made desirable acquaintances
among the foreigners resident in Paris. Morse
took him to call upon Sir John Bowring, editor
of the “Westminster Review,” the translator of
much of the national poetry of the Russians and
Hungarians, and afterwards the English governor
of Hong Kong at the time of the Opium
War. He made acquaintance, too, with Spurzheim,
the phrenologist, who took a cast of his
head; with General Bertrand, who had been with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Napoleon at St. Helena; and with the Countess
Guiccioli, who presented him with a sonnet by
herself, and an autograph note from Shelley.
The glamour of “Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage”
was still over Europe, and everywhere the American
traveler looked eagerly for his footprints.
Mr. Rives, the minister of the United States at
Paris, was very attentive to his young countryman,
and presented him to the king, with two
other American gentlemen, Mr. Ritchie and Mr.
Carr. The latter was American consul at Tangiers.
He took a great liking to Willis, made
him a number of presents, and offered to appoint
him his secretary, and take him to Morocco.
This offer Willis was at first inclined to accept.
It was a tempting one in many particulars, and
in a birthday letter to his mother, January 20,
1832, he thus explained its advantages:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Carr takes me into his family and pays all
my expenses. We go to the old palaces of the Abencerrages,
perhaps the most romantic country in history,
and one very little written about, and it will
double the value of my journey to Morris at the same
time that it secures me from any reverse of fortune.
He means to spend his summers in Spain, which is
right opposite Tangiers at two hours’ sail, and next
fall he will run down to Italy and the Sicilies, thus
giving me every opportunity I want. I have letters
from Lord James Hay to his brother-in-law, the governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of Gibraltar, and one from Lord Fife to the
governor of the Ionian Islands.”</p>

</div>

<p>Why he did not embrace this golden chance
remains uncertain, though he hints at a possible
difficulty in the fact that his friend, the consul,
was a notorious duelist, who had shot seven or
eight men and had a very pretty wife. However,
before he left Paris, Mr. Rives attached
him to his own embassy, a courtesy which proved
of the greatest service to him. It entitled him
to wear the uniform of a secretary of legation,
and the diplomatic button gave him the <i lang="fr">entrée</i>
to the court circles of every country he visited.</p>

<p>Willis saw Paris at an interesting moment.
The Polish revolution had just failed, and the
city swarmed with refugees. Louis Philippe
was already growing unpopular, and there were
continual small <i lang="fr">émeutes</i> on the Boulevard Montmartre,
at the Porte Saint Denis, and in other
quarters, led by Polytechnic students and put
down without much trouble by the troops. It
was a cholera year and people were dying by the
hundreds daily. Meanwhile the gay world went
on much as ever. Carnival was kept with the
usual elaborate follies. There were masked balls
at the palace. Malibran and Taglioni were on
the stage. Paris, with its novelties and splendors,
exercised the same fascination over Willis
that it exercises proverbially over his compatriots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
He was never tired of promenading
and sight-seeing. His lodgings were in the Rue
Rivoli, facing the Tuileries. Sismondi, the historian,
had the apartment under him. In a private
letter he thus describes his daily occupations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have bought a coffee maker and cups, and a
loaf of sugar and a pan, etc., etc., and my hostess’s
daughter, Christine, brings me my bread and butter,
and I breakfast gloriously alone, the doctor (Howe)
being always at the hospitals in the morning. I
breakfast and write all along the forenoon till twelve,
and then see sights and hear lectures till dark, dine
at five or six, and either go to some party in the evening,
or stay at home and study with Zelie.”</p>

</div>

<p>He had no fear of the cholera and firmly believed
that it was not contagious. He was advised
that good living, frequent bathing, a cheerful
frame of mind, and regular habits were the
best preventives. He even went boldly through
the cholera wards of the Hôtel Dieu, and sent a
harrowing description of them to the “Mirror.”
But towards spring the pestilence gained more
and more. The theatres were shut, all gayeties
suspended, and thousands fled the city daily.
The upper classes, who had thus far escaped,
began to be attacked. The streets were almost
deserted, people went about holding camphor
bags to their nostrils, and the panic became universal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Finally, toward the middle of April,
while dancing at a party, Willis was seized with
violent pains in the stomach, vomiting, and chills.
He ran out of the room to an apothecary’s, swallowed
thirty drops of laudanum, took a carriage
home, and a prescription of camphor and ether,
and went to bed. These instant remedies, he
had no doubt, were all that saved him, and on
April 16th he started for Italy.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for the biographer to follow
him step by step in his saunterings through
Europe. These are fully recorded in his letters
to the “Mirror,” which covered a period of four
years, the first appearing in the issue of February
13, 1832, and the last on January 14, 1836.
He began them on the voyage out, as soon as he
had recovered from his first seasickness, and he
continued them until about six months before
his return home. The title “Pencillings by the
Way,” he had used before, but he retained it
and added the sub-caption, “First Impressions
of Europe.” Both described well the character
of these letters, which were written hastily, often
on the wing, and sent off in many cases without
revision, to catch the next packet for America;
in which, moreover, the writer aimed to “record
impressions, not statistics.” There were one
hundred and thirty-nine of them in all, and they
were designed to appear weekly so far as possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
But by reason of irregular postal facilities,
they averaged less than one a fortnight,
and sometimes a month or more elapsed between
two of them. They were read with eagerness
in America, and Morris asserted that they were
copied into five hundred newspapers. Their
popularity is explained in part by the fact that
Europe was much farther off from us in those
days than it is now. The voyage by sailing-vessel
was tedious, and few Americans went abroad
for pleasure. Willis, to be sure, professed himself
astonished by the numbers of his countrymen
whom he met in Italy and elsewhere, but
these were but a handful compared with the annual
horde of tourists who rush back and forth
in the steamers, and do Great Britain and the
continent in three months. It is also true that
the literature of travel was not then so abundant.
The time has gone by for first impressions of
countries. The reader now demands a more
minute and authoritative study of some single
corner of the map. Yet this does not serve to
account altogether for Willis’s success in his
“Pencillings.” There were already plenty of
books by American travelers in Europe, such as
they were, which have long been obsolete. Who
ever hears nowadays of James’s “Travels,” for
instance, published in 1820; or of Austin’s “Letters
from London,” 1804; or of “A Journal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a Tour in Italy by an American,” 1824; to say
nothing of innumerable “Americans in Paris,”
and “Americans in London,” of later dates?
The truth is that Willis’s rapid sketches were
capital writing of their kind, and the work of a
born “foreign correspondent.” He was a quick
and sympathetic, though not a subtle observer,
had an eye for effect, and a journalist’s instinct
for seizing the characteristic features of a scene
and leaving out the lumber. Few of his letters
are in the least guide-bookish. His raptures in
stated places for admiration, such as galleries,
palaces, and cathedrals, are sometimes conventional,
and doubtless his passing judgments on
famous works of art are often either at second
hand or incorrect. His education had not prepared
him to pronounce on these, and he had
not the patience to cultivate a critical appreciation
of them. But in the crowd and out of
doors&mdash;whither he gladly escapes&mdash;he is always
happy, and there are many pictures, scattered
here and there through these excellent letters,
which for sharpness of line and brightness of
color have not been excelled either by Hawthorne,
in his “Note-Books,” or by Bayard Taylor,
in his numerous views, afoot or otherwise, or
by Henry James, in his more penetrating and
far more carefully finished studies.</p>

<p>Willis did not sit down in Europe, like Longfellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and become the interpreter to the New
World of the Old World’s romantic past. He
was never much of a scholar. The literature
and legends of the countries he traveled had little
to give him, though he possessed just enough
of the historic imagination for the proper equipment
of a picturesque tourist. In general it was
the present that interested him: all this stirring
modern life, the strange manners and dresses,
the changing landscapes, the gay throngs in the
streets, the pretty women and notable men at
the drive or the ball. Nor was his attitude that
of criticism, but rather of intense personal enjoyment.
He had gone out ready to be pleased,
and he was pleased. He gave, in consequence,
a somewhat rose-colored view of Europe to his
readers at home. Not that the disagreeable
side escaped his notice, but he was having his
holiday and he gave a holiday account of it, and
his engaging egotism lent a personal interest to
his descriptions. The “Edinburgh Review,”
in a just but rather heavy notice of “Pencillings,”
complained of the scantiness of useful information
in them. Useful information was a
thing which Willis eschewed. He took small
interest in politics, public institutions, industrial
conditions, etc.; and he knew that they would
bore nine out of ten among his readers. He
lumped them jauntily under the head of “statistics,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
referred the anxious inquirer concerning
them to the cyclopædias, acknowledged with delightful
candor that he himself was an ornamental
person, and went on with his sketches of
people and places. Yet “Pencillings by the
Way” was a book which so solid a man as Daniel
Webster carried with him on a journey, and
which, says his biographer, “he read attentively
and praised. He said the letters were both instructive
and amusing and evinced great talents
on the part of the author.” They inspired the
young Bayard Taylor with his first longing to
travel. Thousands of Americans have taken
their impressions of Europe from them; and in
spite of all that has since been written by more
leisurely and better instructed observers, they
retain their freshness wonderfully, and present
to the reader of to-day vivid glimpses of the outside
of European life, at a time when steam had
not yet made the byways of all countries accessible.</p>

<p>Willis spent the summer and autumn of
1832 in the north of Italy, making Florence
his headquarters. Dr. Bowring had given him
in Paris a letter to Count Porro at Marseilles.
The latter had been with Byron in Greece,
where Count Gamba, the Guiccioli’s brother,
was of his corps and served under him. He
gave Willis letters to “half the rank of Italy:”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
among others, to the Marquis Borromeo, who
owned the “Isola Bella” in Lake Maggiore.
Porro assured Willis that Borromeo would
give him the use of one of his palazzos, “as
he has five or six and is happy when people
he knows occupy his servants.” The nominal
position of <i lang="fr">attaché</i> to the American legation
at Paris obtained for him a private presentation
to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and an
invitation to the ducal balls and the receptions
at the Casino, both of which were given
weekly. The Florentines did not entertain
much at their houses, but the foreign residents
did, and especially the English. Willis was
dined by Jerome Bonaparte, the ex-King of
Westphalia, who was living at the Tuscan capital
with the title of Prince Montfort, and giving
very exclusive parties. He resorted to the
Saturday <i lang="fr">soirées</i> of Prince Poniatowski, who
professed love for Americans, and whose august
name was afterwards borne by the favorite pony
of the Willis children at Idlewild. In short, he
was freely admitted to Florentine society and
took part in its fashionable intrigues and dissipations.
He secured lodgings in Florence in the
same palazzo with Greenough, in the apartment
just vacated by Cole, the American landscape
painter. Through Greenough he saw a great
deal of artist life in Italy. At Rome Greenough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
subsequently introduced him to Gibson,
the English sculptor, who presented him with a
cast of his bas-relief, Cupid and Psyche. Under
the guidance of the two, Willis amused
himself by trying his hand, in an amateurish
fashion, at moulding in clay. He was flattered
by their assurances that he had a good touch,
and felt half inclined, for a moment, to exchange
his dilettantish pursuit of letters for an
equally dilettantish pursuit of art. His dreams
of the possibilities of such a career took shape
long after in the novel of “Paul Fane.” Greenough
had moulded a bust of Willis at Florence,
and some years after he cut it in marble and
gave it to him. There is a story about this
which is authentic, and too pretty to leave untold.
Mr. Joseph Grinnell of New Bedford
happened to be in Florence in the spring of
1830 and had employed Greenough to make
him a statue of his niece Cornelia,&mdash;then a
child of five years,&mdash;who became in time Willis’s
second wife. It was from a remnant of
the same block used for her statue that the
sculptor, unconscious of the omen, afterwards
carved the bust of her future husband. The
two fragments thus strangely reunited stand
now in the same drawing-room, the head of
the youthful poet, with its Hyperion curls,
and the full-length figure of the demure little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Quaker maiden, holding in one hand a drinking-cup
and in the other a bird. From this portrait-bust
of Willis is taken the engraving by Halpin
in the illustrated edition of Willis’s poems
published by Clark, Austin &amp; Smith, 1859. It
was a fair likeness, but somewhat heavy and
unideal. Its original had grown quite fat
abroad. His inherited tendency to <i lang="fr">embonpoint</i>
was counteracted in later life by the emaciation
of long illness. Even as a young man his
height gave him a look of slenderness, though
his face was full. The “Autocrat,” apropos
of dandies whose jaws could not fill out their
collars, affirms that “Willis touched this last
point in one of his earlier ambrotypes.”</p>

<p>August found him at the Baths of Lucca,
“The Saratoga of Italy,” flirting, and recuperating
from the exhausting effects of an Italian
summer. In a private letter dated on the 20th,
he announces his intention of starting for England
to-morrow by way of Switzerland and the
Rhine, returning to Italy in a few months in
time for the Roman season.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In London I mean to make arrangements with
the magazines, and then live abroad altogether. It
costs so little here and one lives so luxuriously too,
and there is so much to fill one’s mind and eye, that
I think of returning to naked America with daily
increasing repugnance. I love my country, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<em>ornamental</em> is my vocation, and of this she has none.
I shall pass the next summer, perhaps, in Germany at
a university, and I mean to learn German thoroughly.
You would be astonished at the facility of learning a
language <em>in the country</em>. I speak French well and
Italian passably, and you know how little I knew and
how short a time I have been abroad.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This programme was altered for some reason.
Instead of starting for England, he made a
second visit to Venice, then returned to Florence,
and when the autumn was far enough
advanced to make it safe went on to Rome. In
the letter just quoted he mentions that he has
made the acquaintance of a young Mr. Noel, a
cousin of Byron.</p>

<p>The winter of 1832-33 and the spring of 1833
were spent between Florence, Rome, and Naples.</p>

<p>Wherever he traveled he made friends. He
was not without a title to his secretary’s button,
for his whole progress through Europe was
a ticklish feat of diplomacy. Few of the people
whom he met in society suspected what
thin ice he was skating on, or dreamed for an
instant that the dashing young <i lang="fr">attaché</i> was dependent
for his bread and butter on weekly
letters to a newspaper. The failure of remittances
from Morris sometimes put him in
an awkward predicament, but he always managed
to find a way out. In one of the letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
which he made it a religion to write his mother
on each recurring birthday&mdash;this one dated at
Florence, January 20, 1833&mdash;he relates some
of his experiences of the kind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have dined with a prince one day and alone
for a shilling in a cook-shop the next. I have twice
been entirely destitute of money in places where I
had not an acquaintance, and the instant before the
last coin was out of my pocket, chances too improbable
for a dream have provided for me. One was
at Marseilles. I had relied on receiving a letter of
credit when I got there. I was disappointed and
was at the hotel a week, wondering whether I should
find fate working its usual miracle for me. I had
only two francs remaining, when a gentlemanly man,
who had commenced conversation with me at table,
asked me to his room and ended with offering me a
seat in his carriage to Nice. The quarantine drove
him back, but he had brought me two hundred miles
on my route, and knowing my disappointment by my
inquiries at the post office, he offered me the use of
his banker to any amount and took drafts for the
money on my partner in New York. This now is a
thing that does not occur once in a century. I have
corresponded with Doyne (that was his name) ever
since. I find that he is a <em>religious man</em>, and from one
of the first families in Dublin.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">With all his taste for luxury, Willis knew how
to make economies, and living was much cheaper
then. He never affected a mystery, and in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of his letters to the “Mirror” he explained
how it was that he could live in Florence on
three hundred dollars a year “exclusive of postage
and pleasure,” paying four dollars a month
for his apartment and attendance, breakfasting
for six cents, and dining “quite magnificently”
for twenty-five. Meanwhile a deal of gossip
about him was in circulation in America, and
the editor of the “Mirror” had to contradict,
<i lang="la">inter alia</i>, a rumor that his foreign collaborator
had married the widow of a British nobleman
and was faring sumptuously in Rome.</p>

<p>Having been invited by the officers of the
frigate United States to join them in a six
months’ cruise up the Mediterranean, he repaired
to Leghorn, from which port the United
States, with her consort the Constellation, set
sail on the 3d of June, 1833. Commodore
Patterson of Baltimore commanded the former
ship and Captain Reed of Philadelphia the latter.
Both gentlemen were accompanied by their
wives and the commodore by his three beautiful
daughters. These were all old friends of
Willis, and he had made acquaintance with the
other officers of the squadron in Italy. He
could not have seen the East under pleasanter
auspices, and the next half year was the richest
in literary fruit of his entire sojourn upon the
continent. The squadron loitered along like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
pair of pleasure yachts, touching at all the
more interesting ports. The bright shores of
the Mediterranean and the Levant passed in a
magic panorama before the eyes of the passengers,
who sailed and danced and ate the lotus
day after day. Elba, Naples, and Sicily; Trieste
and Vienna; the Ionian Islands, Greece, and the
shores of the Dardanelles were visited in turn,
and at length in October the frigate dropped
anchor in the Golden Horn. Willis’s “Pencillings”
of Constantinople are among the best in
his portfolio, among the best, indeed, that have
ever been made of the surface of Oriental life.
Italy was hackneyed: the Rialto and Saint
Mark’s, the Coliseum and the Vatican, Pompeii
and the Bay of Naples, had been described a
thousand times. But here he was off the track
of common tourists. His nature reveled in the
barbaric riches of the East and cheerfully
blinked the discomforts and the dirt. The mysteries
of the seraglio and the slave market and
the veiled women in the bazaars piqued his
curiosity, and the poetry of the Turkish cemeteries
and mosques appealed to his sentiment.
He was never weary of wandering through the
grand bazaar. “I have idled up and down in the
dim light and fingered the soft henna, and
bought small parcels of incense wood for my
pastille lamp, studying the remarkable faces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the unconscious old Mussulmans, till my mind
became somehow tinctured of the East, and my
clothes steeped in the mixed and agreeable
odors of its thousand spices.” Willis was a
born shopper and had a feminine eye for the
niceties not only of costume, but of upholstery,
pottery, and all kinds of purchasable knick-knacks.
He relished a fine appeal to his senses
and his fancy all in one. So he liked to go
through the street of the confectioners and
taste the queer sweetmeats with flowery names,
“peace to your throat” and “lumps of delight,”
and to inventory the merchants’ stock in trade,
their gilded saucers, brass spoons, and vases of
rose water. He liked the opium-eating druggists,
smoking their narghiles and fingering
their spice wood beads, the edges of their jars
“turned over with rich colored papers (a peculiar
color to every drug), and broad spoons of
box-wood crossed on the top.” He delighted to
cheapen amber and embroidered slippers in the
Bezestein, and best of all to lounge on the
cushioned divan, taking sherbet and aromatic
coffee and bargaining for attar of roses in the
octagonal shop of Mustapha, the perfumer to
the Sultan, whom he has introduced as a <i lang="la">deus
ex machina</i> into his story, “The Gypsy of Sardis.”
In the “Letters from under a Bridge,”
he affirms, whether seriously or not I cannot say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that the English artist Bartlett, who was his collaborator
in “American Scenery,” encountered
old Mustapha in Constantinople, and that the
latter showed him Willis’s card “stained to a
deep orange with the fingering of his fat hand,
unctuous from bath hour to bath hour with the
precious oils he traffics in.” He questioned
Bartlett about America, “a country which to
Mustapha’s fancy is as far beyond the moon as
the moon is beyond the gilt tip of the seraglio,”
and finally gave him a jar of attar of jasmine
to send to Willis. “The small gilt bottle,
with its cubical edge and cap of parchment, lies
breathing before me.” Then there was the street
of the booksellers, where “the small brown reed
stood in every clotted inkstand,” and the bearded
old Armenian bookworm, interrupted in eating
rice from a wooden bowl, took down an illuminated
Hafiz, “and opening it with a careful
thumb, read a line in mellifluous Persian.” Willis
also struck up an acquaintance with Dr. Millingen,
the Sultan’s physician, who had attended
Byron in his last illness. He spent two days
with him, by invitation, at his house on the Bosphorus,
and picked up a smattering of Romaic
from Mrs. Millingen, who was a Greek.</p>

<p>After five weeks at Constantinople, the frigate
weighed anchor for Smyrna. There he found
an old schoolmate, Octavus Langdon, a Smyrniote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
merchant, who entertained him very hospitably,
and invited him to join a party for a
few days’ tour in Asia Minor. The party consisted
of Willis and his host, an American missionary
named Brewer, and two other gentlemen,
and their adventures included a night in a real
Oriental khan at Magnesia, and a visit to the
site of ancient Sardis. A beautiful girl, of
whom Willis caught a glimpse, through a tent
door, in a gypsy encampment on the plain of
Hadjilar, was the original of his “Gypsy of
Sardis.” At Smyrna he said good-by to Commodore
Patterson and his other friends on the
United States; and the ship which had been his
home for more than six months sailed away to
winter at Minorca, leaving him “waiting for a
vessel to go&mdash;I care not where. I rather lean
toward Palestine and Egypt, but there are no
vessels for Jaffa or Alexandria.”</p>

<p>By this time Willis’s literary reputation had
penetrated to the London press, though not as yet
to the London public, possibly through scattered
copies of his “Mirror” letters; and while staying
at Smyrna he received “an offer of a thousand
dollars a year to write for the London
‘Morning Herald.’ But the articles were to be
<em>political</em>, and that I had modesty enough to
think beyond my calibre. I was to live abroad,
however, and go wherever there was a war or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the prospect of one. I would much rather write
about pictures and green fields.” The not unpleasant
hesitation as to his next move was
ended at last by the departure from Smyrna of
the Yankee brig Metamora, bound for his native
Portland with a cargo of figs and opium. The
skipper, a Down-Easter, agreed to take him as a
passenger, and land him at Malta. At Malta,
accordingly, he arrived late in December, after
being nearly shipwrecked in a Levanter, and
was put ashore through a heavy sea in the brig’s
long boat, narrowly escaping being carried all
the way to America. The letter to the “Mirror”
in which this part of his travels was recorded
was lost, and the “Pencillings” leap at once
from Smyrna to Milan. He afterwards rewrote
the episode, turning it into a capital story (“A
Lost Letter Rewritten,” in the “Mirror” for
May 14 and June 11, 1836), which figures in
his collected writings as “A Log in the Archipelago.”
The startling conjunction of East and
Down East on board the Metamora suggested,
no doubt, some of the incidents in “The Widow
by Brevet,” a tale which moves between the
poles of Constantinople and Salem, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>From Malta he made his way <i lang="la">via</i> Italy, Switzerland,
and France to England, arriving at
Dover on the 1st of June, 1834.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>While at Florence, Willis had been introduced
by Greenough to Walter Savage Landor, who
was then living in his villa at Fiesole. Landor
entertained him hospitably, and, at parting,
made him a present of a Cuyp, for which Willis
had expressed admiration, and gave him some
valuable letters to people in England. One of
these was to the Countess of Blessington, and
with it Landor intrusted to his American guest
the manuscript of his “Citation and Examination
of William Shakespeare,” for delivery to the
same lady, under whose superintendence it was
duly published the following autumn. He also
put into his hands a package whose temporary
disappearance was the cause of some blame attaching
to Willis. Landor’s own story of the
transaction, told in an addendum to the first
edition of “Pericles and Aspasia,” is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At this time an American traveler passed through
Tuscany and favored me with a visit at my country
seat. He expressed a wish to reprint in America a
large selection of my ‘Imaginary Conversations,’
omitting the political. He assured me they were the
most <em>thumbed</em> books on his table. With a smile at so
energetic an expression of perhaps an undesirable
distinction, I offered him unreservedly and unconditionally
my only copy of the five printed volumes,
interlined and interleaved in most places, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
with my MS. of the sixth, unpublished. He wrote to
me on his arrival in England, telling me that they
were already on their voyage to their destination.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It seems from Willis’s public explanation in
“Letters from under a Bridge,” that he received
the volumes, which were in a dilapidated condition,
at the moment of starting, and not knowing
how to add them to his baggage he&mdash;rather
carelessly, perhaps&mdash;“sent them with a note to
Theodore Fay, who was then in Florence, requesting
him to forward them to America by
ship from Leghorn.” Fay accordingly committed
them to a Mr. Miles, an American straw-bonnet-maker,
who did send them to New York, where
Willis expected to follow in the course of the
summer and take charge of them. Instead of
doing this, he spent the next two years in England,
and meanwhile wrote to Landor that the
package had been left with Miles, to forward it
to America. Landor “called in consequence at
the shop of this person, who denied any knowledge
of the books.” These, however, after a
brief stay in New York, were consigned to Willis
at London, “and Fay and Mr. Landor both
happening there together, the explanation was
made, and the books and manuscripts restored
unharmed to the author,” but not in time to keep
Willis from going down “to posterity astride
the finis of ‘Pericles and Aspasia.’ I trust,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
continues, “that his [Landor’s] biographer will
either let me slip off at Lethe’s wharf, by expurgating
the book of me, or do me justice in a
note.” In spite of which trust the biographers
have been a little hard on Willis in the matter.
Sidney Colvin, heartened, probably, by the
“Quarterly’s” onslaught, denounces him as “that
most assiduous of flatterers and least delicate of
gossips,” and says that he gave Landor occasion
to repent of his hospitality by consigning his
books to America and then basely lingering on
in England “in obsequious enjoyment of the
great company among whom he found himself
invited:” while Forster, after declaring that
Willis’s “fuss and fury of boundless hero-worship
found in Landor an easy victim,” adds that
“Landor will perhaps be thought not without
excuse for the way in which he always afterwards
spoke of Mr. N. P. Willis.” But whatever
inconvenience the latter may have caused
in this business, he certainly made the <i lang="fr">amende
honorable</i> in the letter to Landor from which
Mr. Forster quotes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have to beg,” he writes, “that you will lay to
the charge of England a part of the annoyance you
will feel about your books and manuscripts. I was
never more flattered by a commission and I have never
fulfilled one so ill. They went to America <i lang="la">via</i> Leghorn,
and I expected fully to have arrived in New
York a month or two after them.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Landor was a man of noble courtesy and most
generous nature, although, to put it mildly, often
unreasonable. The delay and uncertainty about
his precious manuscripts were certainly vexatious
and may, very likely, as his biographer implies,
have influenced “the way in which he always
afterwards spoke” of the man who, innocently
enough, made him the trouble. But up to the
time of this little misunderstanding, his feelings
toward Willis, as expressed in their correspondence,
were exceedingly cordial; as will sufficiently
appear from the following letter, undated, but
written, probably, during the winter of 1834-35:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr dear Sir</span>,&mdash;By a singular and strange coincidence,
I wrote this morning and put into the post
office a letter directed to you at New York. And
now comes Mr. Macquay, bringing me one from you,
delightful in all respects. I know not any man in
whose fame and fortunes I feel a deeper interest than
in yours. Pardon me if I am writing all this illegibly
in some degree, for certainly I shall scarcely be
in time for the post with all the agility both of hand
and legs. For I am resolved to transcribe an ode to
your President in spite of the resistance his [MS.
illegible] has met with,&mdash;indeed, the more am I resolved
for this very reason. I envy you the evenings
you pass with the most accomplished and graceful
of all our fashionable world, my excellent friend,
Lady Blessington. Do not believe that I have written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
any paper in the magazine. Whatever I write I
submit to Lady B. My “Examination of Shakespeare”
I published for a particular and private purpose,
which, however, it has not answered. I should
not be surprised if it procured me a hundred pounds
or more within seven years. Had I known of your
being in England I should have ordered a copy to
have been sent to you. Pray tell Lady Blessington I
have at last received her Byron from Colonel Hughes.
It came a week ago. I think better of him than I
did, and thank her for it. Nevertheless, I suspect
she has given him powers of ratiocination which he
never attained. I must now try to recollect my verses.
So adieu, and believe me,</p>

<p class="center">Ever yours most sincerely,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">W. S. Landor</span>.</p>

<p>Pray write to me when you find time.</p>

</div>

<p>The verses accompanying this letter were the
rough draft of the ode “To Andrew Jackson,”
numbered <span class="smcapuc">CCLXXXVIII.</span> in Landor’s miscellaneous
poems. On his side Willis could not thank
Landor enough for his introduction to Lady
Blessington. “She is my lode star and most
valued friend,” he writes, “for whose acquaintance
I am so much indebted to you that you
will find it difficult in your lifetime to diminish
my obligations.”</p>

<p>In England Willis fell at once upon his feet.
While traveling on the Continent, his intimacies
had been principally among Englishmen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Americans, and though well received in the native
society of Florence by virtue of his diplomatic
credentials, he had remained, after all, a
stranger and a looker-on. A foreign language
imperfectly learned is a barrier to complete intercourse
even in the most cosmopolitan society.
In France and Italy he had made acquaintances;
in England he made friends and formed domestic
ties which bound him to the country as
long as he lived. He did not fancy the French
and Italians, though he found their cities interesting
to visit; but he liked the English and
they treated him well. No American author except
Irving and Cooper had received from them
a tithe of the attentions which they accorded to
Willis; and Cooper, though personally well
liked, had offended British prejudices by his
pugnacious writings and was more popular in
Paris than in London. The next two years of
Willis’s life were perhaps the acme of his social
and literary career, and he always looked back
to them as the brightest spot in his memory.
The experience was not altogether healthy for
him, though it was stimulating at the time. He
was not spoiled by success, but he was naturally
a little intoxicated by it, and a little dazzled by
the courtly splendors of the circles to which he
was now admitted. When he went back to
America, he did so reluctantly, and with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
hope of returning soon to make his home in
England. He found the change to the plainer
conditions of American life a chilling one, and
he had acquired habits and standards which did
not fit in easily with the requirements of a journalist’s
career in a new country.</p>

<p>As soon as he reached Dover he began to have
that feeling of being at home once more which
is familiar to American travelers who make their
first entrance to England by way of the Channel.
Everything was new, and yet nothing was
strange. The blazing coal fires&mdash;it was June&mdash;the
warm carpets, the quiet coffee-room with the
London newspapers on the table, the subdued,
respectful servants, the mother-tongue again,
the plain richness of the furnishings, the snugness
and comfort,&mdash;the Anglo-Saxon knows by
these that he is once more in Anglo-Saxondom.
Arrived at London, he lost no time in delivering
his note of introduction from Landor to Lady
Blessington, who immediately asked him to dinner
and presented him to the <i lang="fr">beaux esprits</i> who
frequented Seamore Place. For this charming
woman her young <i lang="fr">protégé</i> conceived at once the
strongest admiration, tinctured, it may be, by a
tenderer sentiment. Her wit and beauty, her
cordiality and social graces, had drawn about her
a court of statesmen, authors, and notabilities of
all kinds, over whom she presided like the queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of a Parisian <i lang="fr">salon</i>. It was natural that Willis
should have formed, or at least should have politely
expressed, an exaggerated estimate of her
literary gifts. To posterity, who have not the
advantage of her personal acquaintance, Lady
Blessington’s writings seem of very little importance,
with the possible exception of her “Conversations
with Lord Byron,” whose subject
lends it a certain claim to remembrance. At
her house Willis met Bulwer, Moore, Lord Durham,
Disraeli, James Smith, Galt, Procter, Fonblanque
of the “Examiner,” and many other
distinguished men whose portraits he has given
in the “Pencillings” with a sharpness of outline
which makes them increasingly valuable as
their figures recede into history. It is not at
all strange that an enthusiastic and fanciful
young American, without antecedents, ushered
all at once into a roomful of people about whom
all the world was talking, should have been a
little imposed upon by these exalted personages.
He was not in a critical mood, and it may be
freely conceded that he had too high an opinion
of Barry Cornwall’s poetry, and of the electroplated
novels of the authors of “Pelham” and
“Vivian Grey;” and that he exclaimed more
than was necessary over the varied accomplishments
of that gorgeous dandy&mdash;Byron’s <i lang="fr">Cupidon
déchainé</i>&mdash;the Count d’Orsay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Still he kept his head fairly well. Fortunate
in his introductions, he was the man to make
the most of his chances. His talent for society
and his easy assurance put him quickly <i lang="fr">de niveau</i>
with his new acquaintances. He was not
at all above owning that the English nobility,
for example, impressed his imagination. He
liked to stay at their houses; he enjoyed the
wealth, the grandeur, the historic associations
that surrounded them. His appetite for luxury
was gratified by the perfection of all their appointments
in the art of living. The fineness
of their manners pleased his aristocratic tastes
and he could not sufficiently admire the high-bred
women and the simple, cordial, dignified
gentlemen with whom he dined or drove through
the cultivated landscapes. But Willis was no
snob or vulgar tuft hunter. His enjoyment of
his privileges was accompanied with an entire
reserve of his self-respect. He liked the company
of those whom Dr. Johnson was wont to
call “the great.” But though he loved a lord,
he preferred a commoner, if the commoner was
preferable. The Duke of Richelieu, whom he
had met at Lady Blessington’s, and previously
at the French court, he described as “the inheritor
of nothing but the name of his great ancestor,
a dandy and a fool.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“What a star is mine!” he wrote in a letter to his
sister Julia, three days after his landing in England.
“All the best society of London exclusives is now
open to me&mdash;<em>me!</em> a sometime apprentice at setting
types&mdash;<em>me!</em> without a sou in the world beyond what
my pen brings me, and with not only no influence
from friends at home, but a world of envy and slander
at my back. Thank heaven, there is not a countryman
of mine, except Washington Irving, who has
even the standing in England which I have got in
<em>three days</em> only. I should not boast of it if I had
not been wounded and stung to the quick by the
calumnies and falsehoods of every description which
come to me from America. But let it pass! It reconciles
me to my exile at least, and may drive me to
adopt the mother country for my own. In a literary
way, I have had already offers from the ‘Court
Magazine,’ the ‘Metropolitan Monthly,’ and the
‘New Monthly’ of the first price for my articles.
I sent a short tale, written in one day, to the ‘Court
Magazine’ yesterday, and the publishers gave me
eight guineas for it at once. They all pay in this
proportion, and you can easily see, with my present
resources of matter, how well I can live. I lodge in
Cavendish Square, the most fashionable part of the
town, paying a guinea a week for my lodgings, and am
as well off as if I had been the son of the President,
with as much as I could spend in the year. Except
my family now, I have forgotten everybody in America.
[Here follows the passage about Mary Benjamin
already quoted in chapter III.] I never can
return, however, till I can pay my debts, and it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
take me long to lay up three thousand dollars. When
I can do it, I shall, and make America a farewell
visit for years.”</p>

</div>

<p>Willis followed up his advantages assiduously.
He went constantly to Lady Blessington’s, exchanged
calls with Moore, breakfasted with
Procter and also with that entertaining diarist,
Henry Crabb Robinson, to whom he brought a
letter from Landor, and in whose rooms in the
Temple he met Charles and Mary Lamb. His
Parisian acquaintance, Dr. Bowring, was back
in London and introduced him to a number of
people. At an evening party at the Bulwers’
he met Sir Leicester Stanhope, who had been
with Byron in Greece, and with whose beautiful
wife Willis became quite a favorite, composing
his verses “Upon the Portrait of the Hon. Mrs.
Stanhope” to accompany an engraving of her
in Lady Blessington’s “Book of Beauty.” At
the Stanhopes’ he met that famous pair of beauties,
“the Sheridan girls,” Mrs. Norton and her
sister, Lady Dufferin, to the former of whom he
had addressed a poem written at Paris in 1832
and printed in the “Mirror” of July 7, 1834.</p>

<p>It was the height of the London season, and
the opera was in full blast, with Grisi singing
and Fanny Elssler in the ballet. Willis was
admitted to the Alfred Club, and invitations to
dinners and parties began to pour in upon him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
All these gayeties he described in his letters to
Morris, which, losing somewhat, it may be, in
picturesqueness, gained greatly in personal interest
during his stay in England. It was in
the course of this first summer in London that
he got acquainted with Mary Russell Mitford,
who invited him to spend a week at Reading,
and with whom he maintained for some time a
friendly correspondence. A letter to Miss Jephson,
July 23, 1834, gives her first impression of
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I also liked very much Mr. Willis, an American
author, whose ‘Unwritten Poetry’ and ‘Unwritten
Philosophy’ you may remember in my American
book,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and who is now understood to be here to publish
his account of England. He is a very elegant
young man, and more like one of the best of our
peers’ sons than a rough republican.”</p>

</div>

<p>The generally agreeable impression which
Willis made in English society was not without
its exceptions. During this same summer in
London he had been taken by a friend to see
Miss Harriet Martineau. She was then on the
point of embarking for that trip in America, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
very outspoken narrative of which afterwards
caused so many heart-burnings in this country.
Her vinegary reminiscences of Willis, as recorded
in her autobiography, though rather long,
are perhaps worth reproducing here, not only
for their liveliness, but because any contemporary
impression, however unjust and mistaken,
helps to fill out a complete picture of the man,
and there were plenty of people who disliked
Willis cordially.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I encountered,” she says, “one specimen of
American oddity before I left home, which should
certainly have lessened my surprise at any that I
met afterwards. While I was preparing for my
travels, an acquaintance one day brought a buxom
gentleman, whom he introduced to me under the
name of Willis. There was something rather engaging
in the round face, brisk air, and <i lang="fr">enjouement</i> of
the young man; but his conscious dandyism and unparalleled
self-complacency spoiled the satisfaction,
though they increased the inclination to laugh. Mr.
N. P. Willis’s plea for coming to see me was his
gratification that I was going to America, and his
real reason was presently apparent: a desire to increase
his consequence in London society by giving
apparent proof that he was on intimate terms with
every eminent person in America. He placed himself
in an attitude of infinite ease, and whipped his
little bright boot with a little bright cane, while he
ran over the names of all his distinguished countrymen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and countrywomen, and declared he should send
me letters to them all. This offer of intervention
went so very far that I said (what I have ever since
said in the case of introductions offered by strangers),
while thanking him for his intended good offices, that
I was sufficiently uncertain in my plans to beg for
excuse beforehand, in case I should find myself unable
to use the letters. It appeared afterwards that
to supply them and not to have them used suited Mr.
Willis’s convenience exactly. It made him appear
to have the friendships he boasted of without putting
the boast to the proof. It was immediately before a
late dinner that the gentleman called; and I found
on the breakfast-table next morning a great parcel of
Mr. Willis’s letters, inclosed in a prodigious one to
myself, in which he offered advice. Among other
things, he desired me not to use his letter to Dr.
Channing if I had others from persons more intimate
with him; and he proceeded to warn me against two
friends of Dr. and Mrs. Channing’s, whose names I
had never heard and whom Mr. Willis represented
as bad and dangerous people. This gratuitous defamation
of strangers whom I was likely to meet confirmed
the suspicions my mother and I had confided
to each other about the quality of Mr. Willis’s introductions.
It seemed ungrateful to be so suspicious:
but we could not see any good reason for such prodigious
efforts on my behalf, nor for his naming any
countrywomen of his to me in a way so spontaneously
slanderous. So I resolved to use that packet of letters
very cautiously, and to begin with one which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
should be well accompanied. In New York harbor
newspapers were brought on board, in one of which
was an extract from an article transmitted by Mr.
Willis to the ‘New York Mirror,’ containing a most
audacious account of me as an intimate friend of the
writer. The friendship was not stated as a matter of
fact, but so conveyed that it cost me much trouble to
make it understood and believed, even by Mr. Willis’s
own family, that I had never seen him but once,
and then without having previously heard so much as
his name. On my return the acquaintance who
brought him was anxious to ask pardon if he had
done mischief, events having by that time made Mr.
Willis’s ways pretty well known. His partner in the
property and editorship of the ‘New York Mirror’
called on me at West Point, and offered and rendered
such extraordinary courtesy that I was at first almost
as much perplexed as he and his wife were when
they learned that I had never seen Mr. Willis but
once. They pondered, they consulted, they cross-questioned
me, they inquired whether <em>I</em> had any notion
what Mr. Willis could have meant by writing of
me as in a state of close intimacy with him. In like
manner, when, some time after, I was in a carriage
with some members of a picnic party to Monument
Mountain, a little girl seated at my feet clasped my
knees fondly, looked up in my face, and said, ‘O
Miss Martineau! You are <em>such</em> a friend of my
Uncle Nathaniel’s!’ Her father was present; and I
tried to get off without explanation. But it was impossible,&mdash;they
all knew how very intimate I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
with Nathaniel; and there was a renewal of the
amazement at my having seen him only once. I
tried three of his letters; and the reception was in
each case much the same,&mdash;a throwing down of the
letter with an air not to be mistaken. In each case
the reply was the same, when I subsequently found
myself at liberty to ask what this might mean. ‘Mr.
Willis is not entitled to write to me: he is no acquaintance
of mine.’ As for the two ladies of whom
I was especially to beware, I became exceedingly well
acquainted with them, to my own advantage and
pleasure; and, as a natural consequence, I discovered
Mr. Willis’s reasons for desiring to keep us apart. I
hardly need add that I burned the rest of his letters.
He had better have spared himself the trouble of so
much manœuvring, by which he lost a good deal,
and could hardly have gained anything. I have simply
stated the facts, because, in the first place, I do
not wish to be considered one of Mr. Willis’s friends;
and, in the next, it may be useful, and conducive to
justice, to show, by a practical instance, what Mr.
Willis’s pretensions to intimacy are worth. His countrymen
and countrywomen accept, in simplicity, his
accounts of our aristocracy as from the pen of one
of their own coterie; and they may as well have the
opportunity of judging for themselves whether their
notorious ‘Penciller’ is qualified to write of Scotch
dukes and English marquises and European celebrities
of all kinds in the way he has done.”</p>

</div>

<p>The simple American reader will have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
chance to make up his mind, on independent
evidence, of how far Willis was qualified to
write of Scotch dukes, etc.; but meanwhile it is
not true that the audacious article in the “Mirror”
of September 6, 1834 (which was not an
“article,” by the way, but an extract from a
private letter to Morris), conveyed any implication
of an intimacy between Willis and Miss
Martineau. On the contrary, it expressly says
that his acquaintance with the lady was of only
one day’s standing.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was taken yesterday,” it begins, “by the clever
translator of ‘Faust’ to see the celebrated Miss Martineau.
She has perhaps at this moment the most
general and enviable reputation in England, and is
the only one of the literary <i lang="fr">clique</i> whose name is
mentioned without some envious qualification.”</p>

</div>

<p>After some entirely respectful mention of her
manner and appearance, the letter then goes on
to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is no necessity of bespeaking for so distinguished
a visitor as Miss Martineau the warmest attentions
of our country. She goes with high anticipations,
and whatever she may find to object to in
our society and institutions, it will be done, there
cannot be a doubt, in a spirit of womanly and simple
candor. She is sped on her way by the best wishes
of the best hearts in England. I trust she will be
met over there by wishes and welcomes as warm and
as many.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Any one who knew Willis would have felt sure
that his “prodigious efforts” on Miss Martineau’s
behalf sprang from his always good-natured
and sometimes even officious eagerness to be of
service. And most who knew him would probably
have admitted that there was some mixture
of a “desire to increase his consequence” in his
offer of introductions. Motives are usually
mixed in this bad world and Willis was seldom
indifferent to opportunities for ingratiating himself
with people worth knowing. But even so,
it would have been more gracious in the lady if,
after accepting his offers and the attentions of
his partner at West Point, she had taken his
professions for what they were worth, and omitted
this spiteful mention of him in her book.
Had he lived to read the passage, he would
probably have consoled himself with the reflection
that it was better to win smiles from
beauty than approbation from a strong-minded
Unitarian female with an ear-trumpet, or, as he
politely paraphrased it in his letter to Morris,
a “pliable, acoustic tube.”</p>

<p>The last fortnight in August he was ill of a
bilious fever, during which his new friends proved
very kind. Lady Blessington called daily in
her carriage at his lodgings (over the shop of a
baker, who gratified Willis by being overwhelmed
at her ladyship’s condescension), and Dr. William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Beattie, the king’s physician, attended his interesting
patient devotedly and refused to take
any fee. This excellent gentleman, who was the
anonymous author of “Heliotrope” and a prolific
contributor to the Annuals, became a firm
friend of Willis and his correspondent for many
years after his return to America. He was an
intimate of Samuel Rogers and of Thomas Campbell,
whose life he afterwards wrote, and he introduced
Willis to both of them.</p>

<p>By September the latter was sufficiently convalescent
to be ordered into the country. He
had received an invitation from the Earl of Dalhousie,
whom he had met in Italy, to make him
a visit at Dalhousie Castle, near Edinburgh, and
accordingly he set out for Scotland on the second
of the month. Lady Charlotte Bury, a “scribbling
woman,” had given him a letter to her
brother, the Duke of Argyle, and he carried a
score beside to other people in Scotland. At
Dalhousie, the feudal castle of the Ramsays, nobly
situated on a branch of the Esk, Willis was
heartily welcomed, and passed a most agreeable
fortnight. The earl had been governor of the
Canadas in 1831; Lady Dalhousie was an invalid,
and both of them were quiet, domestic
people, kindly and simple, living with the profuse
and even splendid hospitality proper to their
rank, but without ostentation of fashion or gayety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
The house was full of guests, among them
the countess’s niece, Lady Moncrieff, a lovely
widow of twenty-five, who was very polite to
Willis during his next winter in London. The
earl’s son, Lord Ramsay, was home from Oxford
and initiated Willis into the mysteries of shooting
over the stubble. This young gentleman
succeeded to his father’s title in 1838, was a member
of Sir Robert Peel’s ministry from 1843 to
1847, and in the latter year was made Governor-General
of India. It was during his viceroyalty
that the Burmese war was fought, the Punjaub
annexed, and the railway begun from Calcutta to
Bombay.</p>

<p>After leaving Dalhousie, Willis spent a few
days in Edinburgh, where he breakfasted with
Professor Wilson, dined with Jeffrey, and danced
till three o’clock in the morning at the Whig
ball given in honor of Lord Grey. An attack
of scrofula in his left leg, which he chose to describe
in his correspondence with his English
friends as “gout,” was aggravated by this last
dissipation, and after two or three days more of
poultices and plasters at Edinburgh, he took
steamer to Aberdeen. “The loss of a wedding
in Perthshire, by the way, a week’s deer-shooting
in the forest of Athol, and a week’s fishing
with a noble friend at Kinvara (long standing
engagements all), I lay at the door of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Whigs.” He was laid up four days at Aberdeen,
but finally recovered so far as to take coach
seventy miles across country to Lochabers, a
small town on the estates of the Duke of Gordon,
to whom he brought a letter from Dalhousie.
At Gordon Castle he found a distinguished
company and passed ten days of unmixed enjoyment.
There were thirty guests, among whom
were Lord Aberdeen, who had been foreign secretary
under Wellington; his son, Lord Claude
Hamilton, a handsome young Cantab, who invited
Willis to visit him at the university for a
day’s hunt; Lord Aberdeen’s daughter, Lady
Harriet Hamilton, “eighteen and brilliantly
beautiful;” Lord and Lady Stormont, Lord
Mandeville, Lord and Lady Morton, the Duchess
of Richmond and her daughter, Lady Sophia
Lennox, “the palest, proudest, and most high-born
looking woman I ever saw.” This Lady
Sophia Lennox was probably the original of
Mildred Ashly, the disdainful beauty in “Paul
Fane.” She seems to have impressed Willis as
the type and embodiment of English aristocracy.
In a letter to Lady Blessington, written from
Gordon Castle and printed in Madden’s “Life
of Lady Blessington,” he says, “There is a Lady
Something, very pale, tall and haughty, twenty-three
and sarcastic, whom I sat next at dinner
yesterday,&mdash;a woman I came as near an antipathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
for as is possible, with a very handsome face
for an apology.” The same letter gives his opinion
of his host and hostess more unreservedly
than he could venture to do in “Pencillings.”
The duke he describes as “a delightful, hearty
old fellow full of fun and conversation.” Willis’s
letters from Gordon Castle were perhaps
more criticised than any other part of his “Pencillings”
for their alleged violation of the sanctities
of private life. They are, nevertheless,
among the very best passages in his correspondence
and, taken together, they present a brilliant
picture of what is, doubtless, so far as material
conditions go, the most perfect life lived
by man; the life, namely, of a chosen party of
guests, in late September, at the country seat of
a great British noble.</p>

<p>From this pleasant province in the land of
Cockayne, Willis departed toward the last of
the month and, after a tour of the Highlands,
returned October 6th to Dalhousie, where he
passed a few days more and then set out for
England. He had meant, on his way back to
London, to call upon Wordsworth and Surrey,
having letters to both of them, and to pass some
days by appointment with Miss Mitford at Reading.
But continued trouble with his ankle altered
his plans, and, after spending a few weeks at the
country house of a friend in Lancashire&mdash;whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
acquaintance he had made in Italy&mdash;and of
another in Cheshire, he returned hastily to London
by way of Liverpool and Manchester, and
on the 1st of November took up his quarters
there for the winter. At this stage of his journeyings
“Pencilling by the Way” come to an
end. A number of supplementary letters descriptive
of London life, of the Isle of Wight,
of Stratford-upon-Avon, Charlecote, Kenilworth,
Warwick Castle, etc., were published at irregular
intervals in the “Mirror” under the general
heading “Loiterings of Travel.” With letters
from Washington and the paper on “The Four
Rivers,” they make up the “Sketches of Travel”
in their author’s collected works.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
1834-1836.<br />
<span class="smaller">LIFE ABROAD (CONTINUED).</span></h2>

<p>Willis took lodgings at No. 2 Vigo Street.
During the next ten months, which he spent in
London and its vicinity, he found himself something
of a lion. His articles in the English
magazines had begun to be talked about in the
clubs, and society people who had known him
abroad or in London only as a dandy <i lang="fr">attaché</i>
were surprised to learn that “that nice, agreeable
Mr. Willis” was identical with “Slingsby,”
the brilliant American <i lang="fr">raconteur</i> of the “New
Monthly.” He had contributed in the summer
and autumn of 1834 a number of sketches&mdash;“By
a Here and Thereian”&mdash;to the “Court
Magazine:” “Love and Diplomacy,” “Niagara
and So On;” to Captain Marryat’s “Metropolitan:”
an episode of Italian travel, “The Madhouse
of Palermo;” and to Colburn’s “New
Monthly:” “Incidents on the Hudson,” “Tom
Fane and I,” “Pedlar Karl,” “The Lunatic,”
and “My Hobby&mdash;Rather” (the same as “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Mad Senior” in “Scenes of Fear”). The <i lang="fr">nom
de plume</i> of Philip Slingsby he borrowed from
the luckless wanderer in Irving’s “Sketch-Book.”
He followed these up during 1835-36
with “F. Smith,” “Love in the Library”
(“Edith Linsey”), “The Gypsy of Sardis,”
“The Cherokee’s Threat,” “The Revenge of the
Signor Basil,” and “Larks in Vacation.” For
his “Slingsby” papers Willis got double pay:
Colburn gave him a guinea a page, and Morris,
in his contract with whom he had reserved the
right to print twelve sketches a year in the English
magazines, published them simultaneously
in the “Mirror,” and paid for them at the same
rate as for original articles. They were forwarded
to him in proof-sheets or in duplicate
MSS., so as to arrive in advance of the English
periodicals, which sometimes, however, reached
America first, because of the uncertainties of the
mail-carriage by sailing packet. To the “New
Monthly” Willis also contributed a number of
short poems, “Thoughts in a Balcony at Daybreak,”
“The Absent,” “Chamber Scene,” and
“To &mdash;&mdash;” (“Were I a star,” etc.). He wrote
for it after his return to America and after it
was united with “The Humorist” in 1837, under
the editorship of Theodore Hook. His last
contribution to it was “The Picker and Piler,”
in the April number for 1839.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Blessington’s kindness continued after
his return to London, and he was taken up
by other fashionable bluestockings, dined and
wined, fêted and caressed to a degree that may
well have made him giddy. The two rival <i lang="fr">salons</i>
to Lady Blessington’s were Holland House and
the residence of the Dowager Lady Charleville
in Cavendish Square. It does not appear that
Willis was invited to the former, but he went to
the reunions at Charleville House, though not
so constantly as to Seamore Place. Through
Lady Blessington’s influence he was admitted to
the Travellers’ Club, which was the resort of
the ultra fashionable; and, on Sir George Staunton’s
nomination, to the Athenæum, which had
more of a literary tinge than the Alfred or the
Travellers’. Sir George Staunton also presented
him at court, a favor which Mr. Vail, the American
minister, who disliked Willis for some reason,
had declined to render. Another friend gave
him a perpetual ticket to the opera. Among his
patronesses were the Countess of Arundel and
Lady Stepney, who wrote bad novels but gave
good dinners. Lady Blessington’s biographer,
Madden, who saw a great deal of him in those
days, has recorded his recollections of him as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Willis on many
occasions at Gore House, to which reference is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in the rather too celebrated ‘Pencillings by the Way,’
and also at the <i lang="fr">soirées</i> of the late Lady Charleville
in Cavendish Square. Mr. Willis was an extremely
agreeable young man in society, somewhat overdressed
and a little too <i lang="fr">demonstratif</i>, but abounding
in good spirits, pleasing reminiscences of Eastern and
Continental travel and of his residence there for
some time as <i lang="fr">attaché</i> to a foreign legation. He was
observant and communicative, lively and clever in
conversation, having the peculiar art of making himself
agreeable to ladies, old as well as young, <i lang="fr">dégagé</i>
in his manner, and on exceedingly good terms with
himself and with the <i lang="fr">élite</i> of the best society, wherever
he went.”</p>

</div>

<p>The secret of Willis’s agreeableness to ladies
lay in his unfailing deference. It is extraordinary
how many women much older than himself
cherished a warm affection for him. He had
considered the meaning of Bacon’s saying, “No
Youth can be comely, but by Pardon,” and several
of his stories are studies on the thesis that
there is a beauty in age which may inspire passion.
One in particular, not found among his
collected writings, deals with this speculation:
“Poyntz’s Aunt,” published in “The Ladies’
Companion” of December, 1842, where the hero
falls violently in love with a woman of sixty, to
whose niece the family expected him to pay his
court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Willis saw more “life” in London than was
quite good for him, and went into companies
which were less select than the Gore House coterie,
although, to say truth, Lady Blessington
herself was looked upon by “the best people” as
a trifle off color. Her house was frequented by
men who were entirely irreproachable, but the
English ladies were shy of visiting there. This
was due mainly to her rather unusual relations
with the Count d’Orsay. In obedience to the
wishes of the Earl of Blessington, his daughter
by a former marriage had been compelled to
wed the count under penalty of forfeiting her inheritance.
The poor girl reluctantly espoused
the brilliant stranger provided for her by her
father’s eccentric caprice; but the match was
unhappy, and was almost immediately followed
by a separation; notwithstanding which, D’Orsay
continued to live in the closest intimacy with
his wife’s stepmother after the earl’s death, and in
time under the same roof with her. This last arrangement,
which was, to say the least, odd, and
caused much scandal in British society, had not,
however, gone into effect when Willis first came
to London. Lady Blessington had not as yet
moved to Gore House, but was living in Seamore
Place, while D’Orsay had lodgings in Curzon
Street. Nor did the latter’s formal separation
from his wife take place till 1838. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
intimate friend of Willis in London was that
very unconventional, not to say rapid, woman,
Lady Dudley Stuart, the daughter of Lucien
Bonaparte, “a lady of remarkably small person,
with the fairest foot ever seen,” under whose
bonnet “burn the most lambent and spiritual
eyes that night and sleep ever hid from the
world.” She had about her a semi-foreign society,
not without its fascinations, of artists, actors,
opera-singers, refugee nobles, and adventurers
of more or less shady antecedents. In his
“Sketches of Travel” Willis described a very
free and easy supper party, following a private
concert given by Lady Antrobus, at which he
and Lady Dudley Stuart assisted, together with
Grisi, Lablache, Rubini, and other members of
the Italian opera troupe then in London. Of
course neither Lady Antrobus nor Lady Stuart
was mentioned by name in this account.</p>

<p>But Willis’s acquaintance was by no means
confined to the Blessington set, or to the Bohemian
circle that surrounded Lady Dudley Stuart,
but included many families of unquestioned position.
The Ramsays, for instance, were solid
people, above any suspicion of queerness, and the
earl’s niece, Lady Moncrieff, whom Willis visited
in London, was decidedly “evangelical.”
There were two households in particular which
were like homes to him during the last year and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
more of his stay in England. These were Shirley
Park, near Croydon in Surrey, the residence
of the Skinner family, and the Manor House of
the Shaws at Lee, in Kent, only a ten miles’
drive across country from Shirley Park. The
Hon. Mrs. Fanny Shaw was a daughter to Lord
Erskine and a sworn friend of Willis. Mrs.
Mary Skinner was wife to an Indian nabob, a
leader of fashion, and a woman of intellectual
tastes, who patronized letters and entertained
literary people, a kind of Mrs. Leo Hunter, in
short. Willis was introduced to her at Lady
Simpkins’s by Sir John Franklin, in February,
1835, and met her again at a dinner given by
Longman, the publisher, at Hampstead, where
were present, among others, Moore, Joanna Baillie,
Jane Porter, and Miss Pardoe. The last
was a very pretty woman, author of “Beauties of
the Bosphorus,” and other books more remarkable
for their sumptuous illustrations than for
their literary quality. She was a poetess, too,
after her fashion, and once addressed a tribute
in verse “To the Author of Melanie,” which was
printed in the “Mirror” of October 17, 1835.
Both Mrs. Shaw and Mrs. Skinner treated their
young guest with the most delicate and considerate
kindness. They made him offers of pecuniary
help, of which, fortunately, he had no
need to avail himself, as his letters to the “Mirror”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and his “New Monthly” stories (which
added fifteen or twenty guineas a month to his
“poor two hundred a year”) brought him in returns
which were ample for his occasions. The
Skinners had a town house in Portland Place,
and their carriage in London was always at
Willis’s service. Both of these ladies regarded
him as a son or a younger brother. Bruce Skinner,
a son of Willis’s hostess, named one of his
children after him. At Shirley Park and at the
Shaws’ he met a number of very charming people,
and his time there was spent in drives, lawn-parties,
etc. In the library at Shirley Park two
nieces of Walter Scott, the Misses Swinton,
copied for him “Melanie” and “Love in the Library,”
which he was preparing for the press.
An extract from a very confidential letter from
Willis to Mrs. Skinner may be worth transcribing,
to show the terms of frank and cordial familiarity
on which he lived with these excellent
people. After a brief history of his life and a
statement of his financial situation, the letter
concludes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is a passage in your note which pleased
me. You say if you had a daughter you would give
her to me. If you <em>had</em> one I certainly would take
you at your word, provided this <i lang="fr">exposé</i> of my poverty
did not change your fancy. I should like to
marry in England, and I feel every day (more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
more) that my best years and best affections are running
to waste. I am proud to <em>be</em> an American, but
as a literary man, I would rather live in England.
So if you know any affectionate and <em>good</em> girl who
would be content to live rather a quiet life, and could
love your humble servant, you have full power of attorney
to dispose of me, <em>provided</em> she has <em>five hundred</em>
a year, or as much more as she likes. I know enough
of the world to cut my throat sooner than bring a
delicate woman down to a dependence on my brains
for support, though in a case of exigency I could always
retreat to America, and live comfortably by my
labors. Meantime I am the only sufferer by my
poverty, and am <em>not</em> poor, for no man is so who lives
upon his income. <i lang="fr">Comprends-tu?</i> My dear friend,
I have told you what I have told no other person in
the world. Most men and women would think it incredible
that an <i lang="fr">attaché</i> to a legation could keep up
appearances on two hundred a year, or pity him if he
could; and I never thought anybody worth the confidence&mdash;save
only yourself. I would tell Miss Porter
just the same, or Mr. Swinton, but who else?
No one! so <i lang="fr">gardez cela</i>!</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the ball at the Ravenshaws’ exceedingly,
and am so much obliged to you for introducing me to
Praed, whom I like.”</p>

<p>“I have one or two homes in England,” wrote Willis
to his mother, July 22, 1835, “where I am loved
like a child. I had a letter the other day from Honorable
Mrs. Shaw, who fancied I looked low-spirited
at the opera. ‘Young men have but two causes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
unhappiness,’ she says, ‘<em>love</em> and <em>money</em>. If it is
money, Mr. Shaw wishes me to say, you shall have as
much as you want; if it is <em>love</em>, tell us the lady, and
perhaps we can help you.’ Where could be kinder
friends? I spend my Sundays alternately at their
splendid country house and Mrs. Skinner’s, and they
never can get enough of me. I have a room always
kept for me at both places, and there is universal rejoicing
when I come and mourning when I go. I am
often asked whether I carry a love philter with me;
yet with all the uncommon honors and favors shown
me in England, I assure you I never asked or made
interest directly or indirectly for any acquaintance or
any favor since I landed at Dover. <em>What has come</em>
has come of its own accord.”</p>

</div>

<p>Miss Porter and Miss Pardoe were both domesticated
at Shirley Park, and he met there at
different times, as fellow guests, Lady Franklin,
Lady Sidney Morgan, author of once popular
French and Italian travels, and the brilliant
young orator, poet, and wit, Winthrop Mackworth
Praed. Of the latter Willis wrote in the
“Home Journal” many years later: “We were
followers together in the train of the admired
belle (a visitor under the same hospitable roof)
whom I afterward brought home with me to
Glenmary.” Willis attributed to his religious
poetry the honor of his first acquaintance with
Joanna Baillie, Jane Porter, and the Byrons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
For the authoress of “The Scottish Chiefs,” especially,
he formed an enduring attachment, and
she regarded him with an almost motherly affection.
A lifelong correspondence was kept up between
them, and at the death of Admiral Robert
Ker Porter at St. Petersburg in 1842, among the
MSS. found in his sea-chests were ninety letters
from Willis to his sister. The letters from Miss
Porter, among Willis’s private papers, show that
she was an equally indefatigable, through a not
very legible correspondent. Willis encountered
Ada Byron at an evening party in London, and
thought her “earnest and sweet.” Lady Byron,
who was a Unitarian, was much interested by
the spirited sketch of Dr. Channing in a series
of papers on American literature which Willis
had contributed to the “Athenæum,” and she expressed
her favorable opinion of them in a letter
to Miss Baillie, as also her pleasure that her
daughter had made the author’s acquaintance.
Miss Baillie gave this note to Willis for his autograph
book. Byron’s sister, Augusta Leigh,
he also met in London society. She gave him
an autograph letter of Byron, and on the appearance
of “Melanie and Other Poems,” in March
1835, he sent her a copy, and received an acknowledgment
in which she said that the book
contained “some of the most touching and exquisite
lines I ever read.” The venerable Joanna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Baillie wrote him, on the same occasion, a letter
filled with the most graceful compliments.</p>

<p>Among other London acquaintances of Willis’s
at this time were John Leech, the artist, and
Martin Farquhar Tupper, the proverbial philosopher,
who afterwards visited him in America.
A few extracts from a manuscript diary irregularly
kept by Willis from June, 1835, to March,
1836, will serve to show the nature of his daily
engagements and occupations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“June 30. Breakfasted with Samuel Rogers. Met
Dr. Delancey, of Philadelphia, and Corbin, <i lang="la">ditto</i>.
Talked of Mrs. Butler’s book, and Rogers gave us suppressed
passages. Talked of critics, and said that ‘as
long as you cast a shadow, you were sure you possessed
<em>substance</em>.’ Coleridge said of Southey: ‘I
never think of him but as mending a pen.’ Southey
said of Coleridge: ‘Whenever anything presents itself
to him in the shape of a duty, that moment he
finds himself incapable of looking at it.’</p>

<p>“Went to the opera with Hon. Mrs. Shaw and
heard Grisi in ‘I Puritani,’ and saw Taglioni: both
divine. Visited Lady Blessington’s box and Lady
Vincent.</p>

<p>“After to a party at Mrs. Leicester Stanhope’s.
Saw Guiccioli, and was stuffed to the eyelids by
Lady Mary Shepard about my shorter and scriptural
poems.</p>

myself to Harrow to hear the speeches.…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the evening to a party at Lady Cork’s, and
after to Lady Vincent’s <i lang="fr">soirée</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Lady Cork was the aged but still beautiful
Dowager Countess of Cork and Derry; who in
her youth, as Miss Moncton, had been a favorite
of Dr. Johnson, and whose <i lang="fr">soirées</i> in New Burlington
Street, between 1820 and 1840, were
crowded with talent and fashion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

there was nobody left to praise or approve. Why
should he write now? Told story of the man at

home.”</p>

</div>

<p>This <i lang="fr">fête</i> furnished some items for Willis’s
story of “Lady Ravelgold.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“12. Dined with Mrs. Joanna Baillie at Hampstead.
She gave me some of the wedding cake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Ada Byron. Said that her husband, Lord King, was
hated by his own father and mother and often in
want of money, but an excellent person and beloved
by his own second brother, who had received from
the father all that was not entailed. On the death
of the father, Lord K. had nine thousand a year. Mrs.
Baillie said that Lady Byron had given to the present
Lord B. her whole jointure when he came to the
title.</p>

<p>“Went to Lady Blessington at ten, and had a long
talk with Countess Guiccioli, who said she wished
nevermore to be spoken of in good or ill. The evil
was remembered and the good forgotten. She made
a point of never reading the papers.</p>

<p>“Thence to Charles Kemble’s <i lang="fr">soirée</i>. Countess
d’Orsay there.”</p>

</div>

<p>And thus the journal proceeds with its daily
count of dinners, balls, <i lang="fr">soirées</i>, garden parties,
and opera-going, the diarist finally recording
himself as “fatigued to death with dinners and
dissipations.” In fact the pace began to tell
upon him. Following the last entry that I have
copied here, for July 12th, comes the first draft
of a poem, “Thoughts on the Balcony of Devonshire
House at Sunrise after a Splendid Ball:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent1">While we in sadness pass from ours.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is one of Willis’s most genuine utterances.
The same revulsion of feeling is expressed in
“Better Moments” and “She was not There.”
There were two men in him, the worldling and
the poet; and when worn with fashionable dissipation
he was sensitive to the rebuke of the
midnight heaven or of that “awful rose of
dawn” which God makes for himself in the
“Vision of Sin.” But the mood, though sincere,
was not lasting. “Recovered my spirits,”
runs the entry for July 15th, “after a causeless
depression for a week.”</p>

<p>Toward the end of July he escaped to the
country and “passed a month at Shirley Park
and the Manor, Lee, alternately reading and lying
on the grass in delightful idleness, with the
kindest friends and the greatest contentment.”
At Shirley Park there were archery <i lang="fr">fêtes</i>, the
Archbishopess of Canterbury, “lords and ladies
in abundance, and poets and travelers <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>.
It is midsummer,” continues the letter
from which I quote (August 5th), “in cool and
breezy England, five o’clock in the afternoon,
and a beautiful day. The house is in the middle
of a park (nothing but grass and trees) as
large as the Common in Boston, the soft velvet
greensward closely shaven all around the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and a lovely archery ground on the edge of the
lake just beneath my window, with red and gold
targets, and a dozen young girls and beaux with
beautiful bows and quivers shooting with all the
merriment conceivable. There is a beautiful
daughter of Sir Henry Brydges beating everybody,
and my friend Mrs. Shaw, and Lady Encombe,
and quantities of nice people.”</p>

<p>At Shirley Park he had a letter from Jane
Porter, inclosing an invitation to him from Sir
Charles Throckmorton, a Catholic gentleman in
Warwickshire, at whose country seat she was
staying. Willis joined her there on September
10th, but meanwhile something else of great
importance to him had happened. While visiting
at the Skinners’ he had met his fate in
the person of Miss Mary Stace, a daughter of
General William Stace of Woolwich. He saw
her first at a picnic on the grounds of Lord Londonderry,
at North Cray, and “thought her the
loveliest girl he had ever seen.” At Shirley
Park&mdash;whither she came as a guest&mdash;he was
thrown much in her company, and after a week’s
acquaintance made her a proposal of marriage,
and was accepted. On the 1st of September
he went to Woolwich on a visit to the Staces,
and in the course of a day or two asked the
general for his daughter’s hand. It was agreed
that the engagement should be short, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
courtship, and that the wedding should come
off on the 1st of October. Mary Stace, who
became Mrs. Willis on the day fixed, was a girl
of uncommon beauty and sweetness. In appearance
she was of the purest Saxon type, a blonde,
with bright color, blue eyes, light brown hair,
and delicate, regular features. She had a gentle,
clinging, affectionate disposition, adored her
husband, had been religiously and carefully educated,
and possessed the true Englishwoman’s
sense of the importance of the male sex and the
due subordination of woman. Her family were
most worthy and substantial people, and strictly
evangelical. General Stace was the Royal Ordnance
Storekeeper at Woolwich Arsenal. He
had been commissary to the British navy in
Egypt, and commissary of ordnance at the battle
of Waterloo, and had been rewarded for gallant
service in that famous action. He gave
Willis, as a souvenir, a military cloak and an
eagle clasp taken from the body of a French
officer after the battle, which are still preserved
in the family. His son-in-law described him as
honest, hearty, and plain-spoken, with the common
soldierly weakness for telling post-prandial
stories of his campaigns. Mrs. Stace was Irish,
a great singer, and a friend of Tom Moore, who
used to listen to her songs by the hour. There
were five other children besides Mary. Two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the sons were in the army, and afterwards there
were three Colonels Stace. The general agreed
to give his daughter £300 a year, which, with
the £300 or £400 which Willis counted upon
making by literary work, would do, wrote the
latter to Mrs. Skinner, for a poet. Having completed
the arrangements for his marriage, he set
out from London, September 10th, by the Tantivy
coach for Sir Charles Throckmorton’s seat
of Coughton Court. This was a fine old Elizabethan
mansion near Alcester, and Willis spent
ten days there very agreeably, visiting, in company
with Miss Porter and his host, Warwick
Castle, Kenilworth, Stratford, and other points
of interest in the neighborhood. Of these jaunts
an ample narrative is given in “Sketches of
Travel,” originally communicated to the “Mirror.”
Thence he returned to Woolwich, receiving
on his departure an invitation from the hospitable
baronet to bring his wife and stay a
fortnight with him. At Woolwich he was again
joined by Miss Porter, on the 25th, who came for
a week’s visit to the Staces and to be present at
the wedding. From Coughton Court the expectant
groom had written to his friends announcing
his engagement, and received in reply many
expressions of good wishes. Among others, Lady
Blessington wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Anglesey-near-Gosport</span>, <i>September 19, 1835</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Willis</span>,&mdash;Yours of the 16th has
been forwarded to me here, and I lose not an hour
in replying to it. I congratulate you with my whole
heart on your approaching marriage, and wish you
all the happiness you so well deserve, and which a
marriage well assorted will alone bestow. I predict
the happiness I wish you, for you would not, I am
sure, make an unworthy choice, and the distaste which
the scenes you have gone through during the last
year must have engendered in your mind will have
taught you still more highly to appreciate the society
and affection of a pure-minded and amiable woman,
on whom your future happiness will depend. I think
you have acted most wisely, and am sure that the
rational plans you have laid down will insure your
felicity. A residence <em>near</em> London, which gives you
the opportunity of enjoying its numerous advantages,
without weakening your mind by a too frequent contact
with its dissipations, is, of all others, the one I
would select for a literary man, and I shall look forward
with pleasure to seeing you at Seamore Place
in your new and more respectable character of a
Domestic Man, which, be assured, will bestow more
happiness on you than all the futile successes ever
acquired in the heartless maze of fashion and folly,
in whose vortex you have been whirled during so
many months. A Man of Genius is out of his natural
sphere in such a circle; he loses his identity and
blunts the fine edge of his sensibility. You have retired
in time, and will, I am persuaded, have reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to bless the gentle and benign influence that has attracted
you from it to the pure and healthy atmosphere
of domestic life. Be assured, my dear Mr.
Willis, that out of the circle of your immediate family
you have no friend more truly interested in your
welfare or more anxious to promote it than I am, of
which no proof in my power shall ever be wanting.
I shall be in London on the 22d, and shall have
great pleasure in seeing you. Your secret shall be
safe with me, you may be sure. I hope the little tale
will be sent for your correction in a day or two.
Pray have “Ion” left at my house. Mr. Talfourd
requested that it might not leave my possession, so
that in lending it to you I disobeyed his request.</p>

</div>

<p>The old Earl of Dalhousie wrote a letter of
hearty congratulation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Wherever you go or sit down at last,” it said,
“think of us as being with you in our minds’ eye at
least, and if it shall please God that, in the course of
time, we ever meet again, it will be truly a day of
joy here, for from hence I move no more.”</p>

</div>

<p>His son, the young Lord Ramsay, had jestingly
promised to be Willis’s groomsman some
day at Niagara, and the former now reminded
him of it, and asked him to stand up with him,
and Ramsay sent the following excuses some
three weeks after the wedding:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Yester</span>, <i>October 23, 1835</i>.</p>

<p>I promised to play my part as best man, my dear
Willis, at <em>Niagara</em>, and to have descended from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to Woolwich would have been a sad <i lang="gr">bathos</i>, so that it
was perhaps as well that your notice was too short to
allow of the possibility of my being with you before
the 1st of October. Still I can congratulate you as
well at a distance as with my own lips, and though
the romance which we proposed for ourselves is gone,
I am very happy to congratulate you on the prose
reality.</p>

<p>I had written all this to you three weeks ago,
and directed my frank to the Athenæum Club, a place
which I took it into my head you frequented, when,
this morning, the letter was returned by the porter
with a “<i lang="la">non est inventus</i>” written on it. This to save
my character.</p>

<p>Furthermore, your example was so good an one,
and, fortunately, so <em>contagious</em>, that I have fallen a
victim, and am going to be married, and as this is
<em>not</em> a lady’s letter, it will be as well not to keep the
most important part of the intelligence for the postscript,
but to tell you at once that it is to Lady Susan
Hay. If I were to dash out into a rhapsody you,
whose experience of such a situation is of so recent a
date, might easily forgive me, but I will take mercy
even on you. I am happy,&mdash;happy now, and if I
am not happy always in time to come, Heaven knows
how utterly it will be my own fault.</p>

<p>When next summer brings visiting time we shall
meet, I trust, in Scotland, and exchange at once
news, visits, and congratulations.</p>

<p>May I beg, even though a stranger, my compliments
to Mrs. Willis, and believe me</p>

<p class="center">Ever yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ramsay</span>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Skinner wrote, in a letter to Jane Porter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mary Stace is a sweet, gentle, affectionate, lively
girl,&mdash;natural, so that you may see at once there is
no deceit in her and no guile. She is religious, accomplished,
sings sweetly, is pretty, and will make
Willis more happy than any other woman I know.
He will have no heart-burnings, no misgivings with
her, for she is true and sincere. You will love her.
She was so religious, good, and depend-on-able that I
told her she should be my daughter-in-law.”</p>

</div>

<p>In his letters to his folks at home announcing
his betrothal, Willis insisted a good deal on this
point of his <i lang="fr">fiancée’s</i> religiousness, and he evidently
shared the belief commonly held and
proclaimed among men of the world, that religion,
like a low voice, is an excellent thing&mdash;in
woman; a theory which some women resent as a
covert insult to their understandings, and some
men as an open insult to their religion, and
which may be described as the converse of the
proposition that a reformed rake makes the best
husband.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I should never have wished to marry you,” he
wrote to his betrothed, about a fortnight before the
wedding, “if you had not been religious, for I have
confidence in no woman who is not so. I only think
there is sometimes an excess in the ostentation of
religious sanctity, and of that I have a dread, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
have yourself, no doubt. Miss Porter,” he adds, “is
sincere and <em>refined</em> as few professedly religious people
are.”</p>

</div>

<p>In another letter he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mine is not a love such as I have fancied and
written about. It is more sober, more mingled with
esteem and respect, and more fitted for every-day
life. It had well need be, indeed, for I have taken
it in lieu of what has hitherto been the principal
occupation of my life. I am to live for you, dear
Mary, and you for me,&mdash;if you like! That is to
say, henceforth dissipation (if we indulge in it) will
be <em>your</em> pleasure, not mine. I have lived the last ten
years in gay society, and I am sick at heart of it. I
want an apology to try something else. I am made
for something better, and I feel sincerely that this is
the turning-point of both mind and heart, both of
which are injured in their best qualities with the kind
of life I have been leading. Do not understand me
that I am to make a hermit of myself, however, or
a prisoner of you. You will have always friends
enough, and society enough, and change of place and
scene enough. In short, I shall exact but one thing,&mdash;four
or five hours in my study in the morning, and
you may do what you like with the rest.”</p>

</div>

<p>They were married in Plumstead Church, by
the Rev. Mr. Shackleton, on the 1st of October.
“It was a kind of April day,” writes Willis,
“half sunshine, half rain,”&mdash;recalling, somehow,
the coincidence in Julia Mills’s diary between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the checker-board tavern-sign and checkered human
existence on a similar occasion in David
Copperfield’s life,&mdash;“but everybody was kind,
the villagers strewed flowers in the way, the
church was half full of people, and my heart
and eyes were more than full of tears.” The
bridal pair were driven in Mr. Stace’s carriage
to Rochester, posted next day to Dover, and
crossed the Channel on the 3d. They passed a
fortnight at the Hôtel Castiglione in Paris, and
then returned to England, where they spent the
winter, partly in London and partly at Woolwich,
and in visits to the Shaws, Skinners, and
other friends. Willis was busy in getting out
the first and second English editions of “Pencillings”
and the “Inklings of Adventure.” He
presented his bride to his “swell” acquaintances
in London, and was himself introduced by his
brothers-in-law to numbers of military people,
dined at the Artillery Mess, and was given the
freedom of the Army and Navy Club. He set
up an “establishment,” a cabriolet and a gray
cab-horse, “tall, showy, and magnificent.” He
had taken into service a young fellow named
William Michell, the son of his landlady, a
bright and handsome lad, who now made a very
presentable tiger. William went to America
with his master in the spring, remained in his
service during his residence at Glenmary, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
came back with him, in 1839, to England, where
he ultimately got employment as a machinist,
having a good education and a knack at mechanics.</p>

<p>In May, 1836, after many leave-takings, Willis
sailed with his wife for America. His “Lines
on Leaving Europe,”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Bright flag at yonder tapering mast,”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">dated in the English Channel, express the feelings
at once of regret and of hope with which
he set his face homeward after an absence of
four years and a half. These spirited lines are
among the very few poems of Willis which
seem destined to last. They have the real lyrical
impulse, and it is not easy to read them
without emotion. Emerson, who gives part of
the poem in “Parnassus,” omits the closing
stanza, in which the poet touchingly bespeaks a
welcome for his English bride.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“Room in thy heart! The hearth she left</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Is darkened to lend light to ours.</div>

<div class="verse">She was their light&mdash;their very air;</div>
<div class="verse">Room, mother, in thy heart! place for her in thy prayer!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Willis published three books while in England.
“Melanie and Other Poems” appeared
March 31, 1835. It was divided into three
parts and included a selection from the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
volumes of verse published in America, but unfamiliar
to the British public, besides some half
dozen new poems, dated, said the author, in his
prefatory note, from “the corner of a club [the
Travellers’] in the ungenial month of January.”
It was introduced by Barry Cornwall, who
speaks of the poet as “a man of high talent and
sensibility,” and then goes on with some reflections
of a friendly nature on American literature
and the desirableness of cultivating kinder
feelings between England and America. Wilson,
who reviewed “Melanie” very favorably in
“Blackwood’s,” made Procter’s introduction to
it the theme of much elaborate ridicule, in the
well-known style of “Maga,” when rending a
cockney author. He affected to have gathered
an impression from the title-page,&mdash;which described
the poems as “edited” by Barry Cornwall,&mdash;that
Willis was dead, and that Procter
was performing the office of literary undertaker
for “poor Willis’s remains.” “Alas! thought
we, on reading this title-page; is Willis dead?
Then America has lost one of the most promising
of her young poets. We had seen him not
many months before in high health and spirits
and had much enjoyed his various and vivacious
conversation.… But why weep for him, the
accomplished acquaintance of an hour?” He
goes out on the street and tells the first friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
he meets that Willis is dead. “Impossible,”
answers the friend; “day before yesterday he
was sitting very much alive in the Athenæum
Club: here is a letter from him franked Mahon,”
etc. Another Scotch professor&mdash;Aytoun&mdash;who
belonged, like Wilson, to the Tory light
artillery, was moved to write a parody of “Melanie.”
The same humorist also paid his respects
to Willis in one of his “Ballads of Bon
Gaultier,”&mdash;a strenuous piece of North British
playfulness, in which Willis and Bryant are
represented as sallying forth like knights errant
on the Quest of the Snapping Turtle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Have you heard of Philip Slingsby&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Slingsby of the manly chest?</div>
<div class="verse">How he slew the snapping turtle</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In the regions of the west?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The two longest and most ambitious poems in
this volume were “Melanie” and “Lord Ivon
and his Daughter.” The first is the story “told
during a walk around the cascatelles of Tivoli,”
of an English girl, “the last of the De Brevern
race,” who betroths herself in Italy to a young
painter of unknown parentage; but at their
bridal at St. Mona’s altar a nun shrieks through
the lattice of the chapel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The bridegroom is thy blood&mdash;thy brother!</div>
<div class="verse">Rudolph de Brevern wronged his mother,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the bride thereupon “sunk and died, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a sign or word.” The stanza and style are
taken from Byron’s and Scott’s metrical romances.
The very first line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I stood on yonder rocky brow”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is a reminiscence of “The Isles of Greece.”
The second poem, which is equally melodramatic
in its catastrophe, is in blank verse and
in the form of a dialogue between the Lady Isidore
and her father, Lord Ivon. He tells his
daughter (with a few interruptions from her,
such as “Impossible!” and “Nay, dear father!
Was’t so indeed?”) how he had in vain wooed
her grandmother with minstrelsy and feats of
arms, and then her mother more successfully
with gold: marrying whom, he had begotten Isidore,
and afterwards, in remorse for having
dragged his young bride to the altar, had been
on the point of draining a poisoned chalice,
when she had anticipated him by running away
with a younger lover, leaving to his care the
babe, now grown to a woman, who dutifully concludes
the dialogue with, “Thank God! Thank
God!” Both of these poems were imitative and
artificial, and the last not a little absurd. Willis
had no genius for narrative or dramatic poetry,
and when he tried to be impersonal and
“objective,” he wrought against the grain. The
lyrical pieces in the book were almost all of
them graceful and sweet. He himself thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that the best thing in the volume was “Birth-Day
Verses,” addressed to his mother on January
20, 1835. Similar in theme were the lines,
“To my Mother, from the Apennines,” written
at an <i lang="fr">auberge</i> on the mountains, August 3,
1832. The verses to Mary Benjamin, written
in Scotland in September, 1834, have been already
mentioned. They stand in his collected
poems as “To M&mdash;&mdash;, from Abroad,” and were
also incorporated in “Edith Linsey,” under the
title “To Edith, from the North.” “The Confessional,”
dated Hellespont, October 1, 1833,
was also meant for Mary Benjamin. This and
“Florence Gray” had the note of travel. But
a Boston poem, “The Belfry Pigeon,” was the
most popular of anything in the book and has
retained a place in readers and collections to
the present day. These shorter pieces, like all
of Willis’s truest poetry, were purely poems of
sentiment. His description, in “Edith Linsey,”
of Job Smith’s verses as “the mixed product of
feeling and courtesy” applies consciously to his
own. They were “the delicate offspring of tenderness
and chivalry,” airy, facile, smooth, but
thin in content: not rich, full, concrete, but
buoyed up by light currents of emotion in a region,
to quote his own words again, of “floating
and colorless sentiments.” This disembodied
character is a mark of almost all the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
poetry of the Annual or <em>Gemmiferous</em> period,
and is seen at its extreme in the unsubstantial
prolixity of Percival and the drab diffuseness of
Mrs. Sigourney. It was the reflection on this
side the water from Shelley, from Byron’s earlier
manner, from Wordsworth’s most didactic
passages, and from the imitations of all these
by secondary poets, like Mrs. Norton and L. E.
L. Willis’s verses were much better than Percival’s
or Mrs. Sigourney’s&mdash;defter, briefer, more
pointed. But they had a certain poverty of imagery
and allusion which belonged to the school,
a recurrence of stock properties, such as roses,
stars, and bells. He was ridiculed by the critics,
in particular, for his constancy to the Pleiades,
which would almost seem to have been the only
constellation in his horizon.</p>

<p>Toward the last of November, 1835, the first
edition of “Pencillings by the Way” was published.
It was an imperfect one, made up hastily
for the London market from a broken set of
the “Mirror,” and gave only seventy-nine out of
the one hundred and thirty-nine letters since
printed in the complete editions. From this
imperfect copy the first American impression
(1836) was taken, and all in fact down to 1844.
The book reached a second English edition in
March, 1836, and a seventh in 1863. For this
first edition Willis received £250. He afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
testified, that from the republication of
the original “Pencillings,” for which Morris had
paid him $500 a year, he had made, all told,
about $5,000. Their appearance in book form
had been anticipated by a severe criticism of the
original “Mirror” letters, written by Lockhart
for the “London Quarterly” of September, 1835.
This was echoed by the Tory press generally, and
it was their attacks which led to the issue of the
London edition and greatly stimulated its sale.
There were several reasons why the Tory papers
were “down on” Willis. In the first place he
was an American. In the next place he had been
admitted and made much of in English social
circles, where English men of letters, who were
merely men of letters, did not often go. And,
finally, he had spoken disrespectfully in these
letters of the editor of the “Quarterly” himself.
“Do you know Lockhart?” Wilson is made to
ask in Willis’s report of their conversation at
Edinburgh. “No, I do not,” replies his interlocutor.
“He is almost the only literary man in
London I have not met; and I must say, as the
editor of the ‘Quarterly,’ and the most unfair
and unprincipled critic of the day, I have no
wish to know him. I never heard him well
spoken of. I probably have met a hundred of
his acquaintances, but I have not yet seen one
who pretended to be his friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>This paragraph was enough to account for the
“Quarterly” article; but the personal grievance
was kept well out of sight, and Willis was taken
to task for his alleged abuse of the rights of
hospitality in reporting for a public journal private
conversations at gentlemen’s tables. The
article was a very offensive one, written with
ability and with that air of cold contempt of
which Lockhart was master. It sneered at Willis
as a “Yankee poetaster,” and a “sonneteer
of the most ultra-sentimental delicacy;” intimated
that his surprise and delight at the
manners of the English aristocracy came from
his not having been familiar with the usages of
the best society at home, and accused him of
“conceited vulgarity” and “cockneyism” (an
awful word, under which the Scotch Tories connoted
all possible offenses against sound politics
and good literature). The passages that seem
to have given most offense to the critic were the
report of the conversation with Lord Aberdeen
at Gordon Castle and the remarks of Moore
about O’Connell at Lady Blessington’s. “It is
fortunate in this particular case,” wrote Lockhart,
“that what Lord Aberdeen said to Mr.
Willis might be repeated in print without paining
any of the persons his lordship talked of;
but what he did say, he said under the impression
that the guest of the Duke of Gordon was a gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and there are abundance of passages in
Mr. Willis’s book which can leave no doubt that,
had the noble earl spoken in a different sense, it
would not, at all events, have been from any
feeling of what was due to his lordship, or to
himself, that Mr. Willis would have hesitated to
report the conversation with equal freedom.”
The article concludes as follows: “This is the
first example of a man creeping into your home
and forthwith printing,&mdash;accurately or inaccurately,
no matter which,&mdash;before your claret is
dry on his lips,&mdash;unrestrained <em>table-talk on delicate
subjects, and capable of compromising individuals</em>.”
Lockhart, as usual, contrived to
insult Willis’s country, through her representative.
“We can well believe,” he said, “that
Mr. Willis has been depicting the sort of society
that most interests his countrymen.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Born to be slaves and struggling to be lords,’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">their servile adulation of rank and title, their
stupid admiration of processions and <i lang="fr">levées</i>, and
so forth, are leading features in almost all the
American books of travels that we have met
with.”</p>

<p>To this censure Willis replied, in substance,
in the preface to the first London edition of
“Pencillings,” first, that from “the distance of
America, and the ephemeral nature and usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
obscurity of periodical correspondence,” he had
never expected that the “Mirror” letters would
reach England; nor would they have done so,
had not the “Quarterly” “made a long arm over
the water,” and reprinted all the offending portions;
thereby forcing the author’s hand and
compelling him to publish the entire collection
in justification of himself. Secondly, that his
sketches of distinguished people were neither
ill-natured nor untrue; that he had said nothing
in them which could injure the feelings of those
who had admitted him to their confidence or
hospitality. “There <em>are</em> passages,” he allows,
“I would not rewrite, and some remarks on individuals
which I would recall at some cost,”
but “I may state as a fact that the only instance
in which a quotation by me from the conversation
of distinguished men gave the least offense
in England was the one remark made by
Moore, the poet, at a dinner party, on the subject
of O’Connell. It would have been harmless,
as it was designed to be, but for the unexpected
celebrity of my ‘Pencillings;’ yet with all my
heart I wish it unwritten.” And finally, that
whatever violations of delicacy and good taste
might have been committed in the “Pencillings,”
the author of “Peter’s Letters to his Kinsfolk”
was not the one to throw a stone at them. The
first plea in this defense was sincerely made, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
might be easily proved from Willis’s private
letters. It <em>was</em> a disagreeable surprise to him
when the “Quarterly” reprinted passages from
the “Mirror” letters. And it is true that America
was much farther away from England than
England was from America. Still, if Willis had
published anything that he should not have published,
it was not a perfect excuse to say that he
had done it in a corner. As the event showed,
foreign correspondence in an American newspaper
might reach England. But this apology
was not needed, for his second plea covered the
ground. There was, in truth, nothing malicious
or slanderous in “Pencillings;” almost nothing
that could give pain even to the most sensitive.
The people described were, nearly all of them,
in a sense, public characters, accustomed to seeing
themselves gossiped about in print. In one
or two instances Willis had been indiscreet, as
he freely admitted. But it is hard for one living
in these times of society journals and “interviewers”
to understand why the papers should
have made such a pother over a comparatively
trifling trespass upon the reserves of private life.
The best proof of Willis’s innocence in the matter
is that the people whose hospitality and confidence
he was charged with abusing took no
kind of umbrage at the liberty. On the contrary,
Lord Aberdeen, Wilson, Dalhousie, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
others wrote to him in warm approval of his
book. “With what feelings,” said the “Quarterly”
article, apropos of the description of
Gordon Castle, “the whole may have been perused
by the generous lord and lady of the castle
themselves, it is no business of ours to conjecture.”
This point, however, need not be left
to conjecture, as it is amply answered in the following
letter to Willis from the Earl of Dalhousie,
dated February 25, 1836:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>… In the long evenings of winter we have beguiled
the time with “Pencillings by the Way,” and whatever
critics and reviewers may say, I take pleasure in
assuring you that we all agree in one sentiment, that
a more amusing or more delightful production was
never issued by the press. In what we know of it, it
is true and graphic, and therefore in what is foreign
to us, we think, must be so also. <em>The Duke and
Duchess of Gordon were here lately and expressed
themselves in similar terms.</em></p>

<p>Lady D&mdash;&mdash; desires me to say that the reviews
could not have done more for its success by their amplest
praises, for it is now in every hand.</p>

<p>Our family has been much occupied by Ramsay’s
marriage this winter, he following your steps so
closely. He has added greatly to his parents’ happiness,
and, I hope, to his own in life. Lady Susan
Hay is a handsome woman, and an amiable, pretty
creature. They have settled themselves at Coalstown,
until called into a more active life, which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
hope he looks forward to, and you have thought him
fitted for. It is not unlikely that he will be chosen
member for the East Lothian, in which he has made
his residence, triangular between me and his father-in-law,
Lord Tweeddale, about sixteen miles from me.</p>

<p>Pray let me hear from you, as your sincere attached
friend,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Dalhousie</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Lady Dalhousie had written some two mouths
before:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I feel that it is positive ingratitude not to offer our
united thanks for your book, which we received in
safety, and Miss Hathorne and I are now reading it
aloud to Lord Dalhousie in the evening, with very
great pleasure and amusement. Your descriptions
recall to my mind admirably what I have seen, and
paint to my mind’s eye what I wish to see, and the
happy sunshine which your own mind has shed over
every person and thing you have met is refreshing
and enlivening to us, living now much alone in this
dark and gloomy December. The “Quarterly” we
read with extreme wrath and indignation, and, believe
me, it will afford us the most sincere pleasure
if you will take, if you find them worthy of it, a few
more of your spirited pencillings from D. Castle.…
Believe me always very sincerely yours.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">C. B. Dalhousie.</span></p>

</div>

<p>It has been said above that there was almost
nothing in “Pencillings” that could give pain
to any one; but to this statement there are one
or two exceptions. The first was the instance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Moore and O’Connell, in which Willis acknowledged
and regretted his imprudence. “This
publication, to my knowledge,” says Madden in
his “Life of the Countess of Blessington,” “was
attended with results which I cannot think Mr.
Willis contemplated when he transmitted his
hasty notes to America,&mdash;to estrangements of
persons who, previously to the printed reports of
their private conversations, had been on terms
of intimate acquaintance. This was the case
with respect to O’Connell and Moore. Moore’s
reported remarks on O’Connell gave offense to
the latter, and aroused bad feelings between
them which had never previously existed, and
which, I believe, never ceased to exist.”</p>

<p>It also appears from a letter from Willis to
Lady Blessington, and an unsigned note from
a friend of hers to Willis, both of which are
printed in Madden’s “Life,” that Fonblanque
resented the description of himself in “Pencillings,”
and had written the author a note in
terms which the latter thought “very unjustifiable.”
Fonblanque was an able and estimable
man, and Willis’s portrait, or caricature, of him,
though not unkindly meant and applying merely
to his personal appearance, was certainly not
pleasant for the subject of it to see in print.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I never saw,” it runs, “a much worse face; sallow,
seamed, and hollow, his teeth irregular, his skin livid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
his straight black hair uncombed and straggling over
his forehead; he looked as if he might be the gentleman
‘whose coat was red and whose breeches were
blue.’ A hollow, croaking voice, and a small, fiery
black eye, with a smile like a skeleton’s, certainly did
not improve his physiognomy. He sat upon his chair
very awkwardly, and was very ill dressed, but every
word he uttered showed him to be a man of claims
very superior to exterior attraction.”</p>

</div>

<p>With the exception of Lockhart, Moore, Fonblanque,
and Captain Marryat, whose case will
be mentioned presently, it does not appear that
anyone took offense at anything in “Pencillings.”
As to Lady Blessington, Lockhart’s misgiving
as to whether she would ever “again admit to
her table the animal who has printed what ensues”
was needless. It was she who saw the
book through the press while Willis was in
France on his wedding journey. He went to
see her frequently during the remainder of his
stay in London, and called upon her on his two
subsequent visits to England; and their friendship
and correspondence continued unbroken till
her death in 1849. His poem, “To a Face Beloved,”
originally printed in the “Mirror” of
November 14, 1835, was addressed to her. It
may well have been, however, that the noise made
about the book, and the cause for complaint given
to a few of the <i lang="fr">habitués</i> of Gore House, put a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
certain constraint upon his visits there, and he
probably absented himself from the dinners and
receptions given by the mistress of the mansion,
and which it had formerly been his chief pleasure
to attend. In a letter to her from Dublin,
January 25, 1840, he says: “I have, I assure
you, no deeper regret than that my indiscretion
(in ‘Pencillings’) should have checked the freedom
of my approach to you. Still my attachment
and admiration (so unhappily recorded)
are always on the alert for some trace that I am
still remembered by you.… My first pleasure
when I return to town will be to avail myself of
your kind invitation, and call at Gore House.”</p>

<p>In spite of the “Quarterly’s” attack&mdash;partly
no doubt in consequence of it&mdash;“Pencillings by
the Way” met, on the whole, with a generous
reception from the English public, and even
from the English press. Literary criticism in
those days was largely influenced by political
prejudice. It was useless for a Whig, a “Cockney,”
or an American, to hope for justice from
the Tory reviews. The “Westminster” (Radical)
was edited by Willis’s friend, Dr. Bowring;
the “Edinburgh” (Whig), by his acquaintance,
Lord Jeffrey. The former accordingly greeted
his book with warm approval, and the latter
praised it with faint damns. On the other hand,
“Fraser’s,” the lightest and brightest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Tory organs, received it with uproarious contempt.
The notice of “Pencillings” in the February
number of the magazine for 1836 was by
Maginn,&mdash;the “Odoherty” of the “Noctes,”&mdash;a
witty Irish blackguard, the hired bravo of
the Tory press, who spent his time, except when
drunk or in jail for debt, in writing lampoons
and rollicking songs for “Blackwood” and “Fraser,”
expressive chiefly of convivial joys and of
boisterous scorn of the Whigs. There was a flavor
of whiskey and Donnybrook about whatever
Maginn wrote, and he wielded his blackthorn
with such droll abandon that his victims could
hardly help laughing, while rubbing their heads.
His onslaught on “Pencillings” began, “This
is really a goose of a book, or if anybody wishes
the idiom to be changed, a book of a goose.
There is not a single idea in it, from the first
page to the last, beyond what might germinate
in the brain of a washerwoman.” He then goes
on to call the author a lickspittle, a “beggarly
skittler,” a jackass, a ninny, a haberdasher, a
“namby-pamby writer in twaddling albums, kept
by the moustachioed and strong-smelling widows
or bony matrons of Portland Place;” a “fifty-fifth
rate scribbler of gripe-visited sonnets,” a
“windy-gutted visitor,” and a “sumph,” whatever
that mystic monosyllable may import.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
writing is characterized as “chamber-maid gabble,”
“small beer,” “penny-trumpet eloquence,”
“Willis’s bray,” and “Niagara in a jordan.”
President Jackson, whom Maginn supposes to
have appointed Willis <i lang="fr">attaché</i> to the French embassy,
is “that most open-throated of flummery-gulpers,
Old Hickory.” Alluding to a passage
in Willis’s “slimy preface,” the reviewer says,
“that Willis should literally set his foot on
Lockhart’s head is what we think no one imagines
the silly man to have meant. The probabilities
are that if the imposition of feet should
take place between them, the toe of Lockhart
would find itself in disgusting contact with a
part of Willis which is considerably removed
from his head, and deemed to be the quarter
in which the honor of such persons is most peculiarly
called into action.” Such were the
amenities of criticism half a century ago. Of
course this animated billingsgate could not hurt
Willis in anybody’s esteem, and called for no
reply. Maginn was a wretched creature and no
one minded what he said; though, to be sure,
the Hon. Grantley Berkeley thought it necessary,
in this same year, 1836, to call him out
for a scurrilous attack upon himself and his
cousin, Lady Euston, in a notice of Berkeley’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
novel, “Castle Berkeley.” The latter, in his
very diverting “Life and Recollections,” gives
a circumstantial history of this duel and of the
flogging which he administered to Fraser for
publishing the article, and of Maginn’s shameful
treatment of poor Miss Landon.</p>

<p>But one of the notices provoked by “Pencillings”
came near having serious consequences
for Willis. In a letter in the “Mirror” of
April 18, 1835, he had inserted a postscript,
after his signature, as he claimed, and meant
only for Morris’s private eye, giving some information
about the sales of books in London.
In this occurred, among other things, the sentence
following: “Captain Marryat’s gross trash
sells immensely about Wapping and Portsmouth,
and brings him five or six hundred the book,
but that can scarce be called literature.”
Morris printed it with the rest of the letter, and
when it reached England the gallant captain
was naturally displeased by it. His revenge was
to publish in his magazine, the “Metropolitan”
for January, 1836, a review of “Pencillings,”
or rather a grossly personal review of the author
of “Pencillings.” The article was less telling
than the “Quarterly’s,” simply because Marryat
did not drive so sharp a quill as the editor of the
“Quarterly.” But the latter knew his business
as a reviewer and confined himself to the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in hand. Marryat, on the contrary, traveled
outside the record and helplessly allowed his
private grievance to appear. He declared that
Willis was a “spurious <i lang="fr">attaché</i>,” who had made
his way into English society under false colors.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He makes invidious, uncharitable, and ill-natured
remarks upon authors and their works; all of which
he dispatches for the benefit of the reading public
of America, and, at the same time that he has thus
stabbed them behind their backs, he is requesting to
be introduced to them&mdash;bowing, smiling, and simpering.”
“Although we are well acquainted with the
birth, parentage, and history of Mr. Willis, previous
to his making his continental tour, we will pass them
over in silence; and we think that Mr. Willis will
acknowledge that we are generous in so doing.”
“It is evident that Mr. Willis has never, till lately,
been in good society, either in England or America.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Finally he exhumed from some quarter the pasquinade
of poor Joe Snelling, referred to in our
third chapter, from which he printed the following
lines by way of showing Willis’s standing at
home:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Marryat’s article was a stupid one, ungrammatical
and coarsely written. But its clumsy malice
made it all the more exasperating. Lockhart
was a gentleman and Maginn was an Irishman.
The former took care not to say too much, and
what the latter said was of no consequence.
Both of them, besides, were clever writers, and
a man of wit and spirit had rather be pricked
by a rapier in the hand of a dexterous adversary
than pounded on the head by an awkward bully
with a bludgeon. Willis made a mistake in noticing
Marryat’s article at all, but he was stung
by the implied insult to his parents, and his military
friends persuaded him that his honor was
touched. Accordingly he prepared an elaborate
reply in the shape of a letter, dated January
10th, and sent it to Marryat at Brussels, whither
the latter had gone about the middle of December,
while his article was still in proof.</p>

<p>“Of that part of the paper which refers to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
merits of my book,” Willis wrote, “I have nothing
to say. You were at liberty, as a critic, to
deal with it as you pleased. You have transcended
the limits of criticism, however, to make
an attack on my character, and your absence
compels me to represent, by my own letter, those
claims for reparation which I should have intrusted
to a friend, had you been in England.”
The letter then proceeds to answer, in detail, the
charges and innuendoes of the “Metropolitan.”
As to his seeking introductions, Willis declares,
“I have never, since my arrival in England,
requested an introduction to <em>any man</em>.… In
the single interview which I had with yourself,
I was informed by the lady who was the medium
of the introduction, that <em>you wished</em> to know
me.” The letter concludes, apropos of Marryat’s
slur on Willis’s birth and parentage,
“You will readily admit that this dark insinuation
must be completely withdrawn. My literary
reputation and my position in society are
things I could outlive. My honesty as a critic
is a point on which the world may decide. But
my own honor and that of my family are sacred,
and while I live, no breath of calumny shall
rest on either. I trust to receive, at your earliest
convenience, that explanation which you cannot
but acknowledge is due to me on this point,
and which is most imperatively required by my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
own character and the feelings of my friends.”
As to the remark which had drawn the “Metropolitan”
article upon him, Willis confesses that
it was an unjust one, but says that “it occurred
in a private communication to the editor of the
‘Mirror’ and was never intended for publication.”</p>

<p>Willis had this letter lithographed and sent
copies to seven of his particular friends, to clear
his character, as he said, in his own immediate
circle, of the aspersions in Marryat’s article.
The reply to this demand was a long letter, under
date of January 21st, declining to make any apology
until Willis had publicly withdrawn his remark
in the “Mirror” about Marryat’s gross
trash selling about Wapping, etc., which, said the
latter, amounted by implication to an attack on
his private character; denying, furthermore,
that <em>he</em> had attacked <em>Willis’s</em> private character.
“The observations made by you upon my writings
must be considered as more or less injurious
in proportion to the rank in society and estimation
of the person who made them.… It was
therefore necessary, in this instance, to point out
that the critic had not been accustomed to good
society.… Now this, if true, is no crime, and
therefore the remark can be no attack upon private
character.” Willis accepted this explanation,
in a second letter to Marryat, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
sent the entire correspondence to the “Times”
for publication. Marryat was furious at this,
and wrote at once to Willis, “I refuse all explanation&mdash;insist
upon immediate satisfaction&mdash;and
that you forthwith repair to Ostend to meet
me.” If the captain thought that his opponent
was a dandy poet, who would be afraid to face
his pistol, he mistook his man. “The puppies
will fight,” said the Duke. Willis was no shot,
and the only weapon that he knew how to handle
was his pen, but he never showed any want of
personal courage. The correspondence that followed
this challenge was long and tedious. The
documents in the case are a score in number and
need not be reproduced here. The substance of
these various protocols and formalities was as
follows. Willis answered Marryat’s letter, explaining
why he had thought right to publish
the first three letters that had passed between
them, accepting his challenge, in case he found
this explanation insufficient, but claiming his
privilege, as the challenged party, to name some
place in England for the meeting. Meanwhile
a duplicate of Marryat’s challenge had been
handed to Willis by the former’s “friend,” a
Mr. F. Mills, and Willis had referred him to
<em>his</em> friend, Captain Walker, and had agreed to
waive his right to name a place, and to meet
Marryat at Ostend. Mr. Mills and Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Walker finally adjusted the matter and arranged
a basis for an amicable settlement. But while
these negotiations were pending, Marryat, on
the receipt of Willis’s letter of explanation,
withdrew his challenge in a letter dated February
9th, which he sent to the “Times,” along
with his challenge and Willis’s reply to it. The
terms of this withdrawal Willis considered insulting,
and the publication of the challenge
after it had been agreed upon between the
friends of the parties that Marryat “should entirely
withdraw the offensive letter containing
his challenge,” he regarded as a further insult.
He therefore wrote to the “Times,” on the day
following the appearance of these letters, that
the differences between himself and Captain
Marryat were <em>not</em> at an end; and on February
17th he wrote to Marryat that his challenge
still stood accepted, insisting on his right to
name England as the place of meeting, but offering
in case of interruption there to give him
a meeting on the other side of the Channel.
Marryat accordingly came to England and&mdash;Mr.
Mills having withdrawn from the affair&mdash;named
as his second Captain Edward Belcher of
the Royal Navy. Captain Belcher’s ship was at
Chatham and thither all parties repaired on the
27th of February. Willis’s second declared to
Captain Belcher that his principal “had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to fight, not to negotiate,” but on a little discussion
Captain Belcher found his principal in the
wrong, and made him concede what was necessary,
the following pronunciamento being signed
by both seconds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Chatham.</span></p>

<p>Captain Marryat and Mr. Willis having placed the
arrangement of the dispute between them in our
hands, and both parties having repaired hither with
the intent of a hostile meeting; we have, previously
to permitting such to take place, carefully gone
through the original grounds of quarrel, which do not
appear to us of sufficient importance to call for a
meeting of such a nature.</p>

<p>We are perfectly borne out in this opinion by the
arrangement of the 8th of February entered into by
the mutual friends of the parties, and on which we
think Captain Marryat ought to have withdrawn his
challenge of the 4th inst.</p>

<p>That the new quarrel arises from the publication of
the challenge and subsequent letters, in which, in our
opinion, Captain Marryat was not justified. We are
further of opinion that both parties should mutually
withdraw the offensive correspondence, the terms on
either side being unjustifiable, and we conceive that
they more honorably act in so doing than in meeting
in the field.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Edward Belcher.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">F. G. Walker.</span></p>

</div>

<p>Thus peacefully ended this tempest in a teapot.
Willis had carried his point and had acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
throughout in a high-spirited and creditable
manner&mdash;barring the folly of entering into
“an affair of honor,” in the first place. His
letters to Marryat are those of a gentleman,
while his adversary’s language is invariably
hectoring and coarse. The quarrel, of course,
made a great deal of noise at the time in London
literary and social circles. “The United
Service Gazette,” the organ of the British
Army and Navy, took Willis’s side in a long editorial
in which much of the correspondence was
reprinted from the “Times.” The latter journal,
however, probably voiced the true sentiment
of the community when it said: “We
confess that we have a great distaste for this
sort of squabbling, which exhibits, to say the
least, an extraordinary want of judgment in the
disputing parties.”</p>

<p>From Chatham Willis posted at once to
Woolwich, thirty miles away, where he found his
wife in convulsions. He had left a farewell
letter for her, fully expecting to be killed in a
duel with Marryat, who was reputed a crack
shot. Two days later Willis went to London
and called out Mr. F. Mills, who had acted as
Marryat’s “mediator,” for an offensive letter in
the “Times.” Mr. Mills named W. F. Campbell
of Islay and Willis named John Tyndale,
between whom this subsidiary quarrel was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
patched up, in a manner honorable to both. The
assaults in the English magazines and the rumors
of the Marryat affair of course found their
way speedily to America, and were circulated
and commented upon in the American periodicals
according to their various prepossessions.
“The cultivated old clergymen of the ‘North
American Review,’” as Poe used to call them,
lent the support of that influential quarterly to
Willis in an article by C. C. Felton, a very
friendly review of the “Pencillings,” and a defense
of their author&mdash;a favor which Willis
gratefully appreciated.</p>

<p>In March, 1836, he published in London
“Inklings of Adventure,” consisting of thirteen
stories and sketches of American and European
life, reprinted from the “New Monthly,” “The
Metropolitan,” and the “Court Magazine,” together
with “Minute Philosophies” (from the
“American Monthly”) and “A Log in the Archipelago,”
from the “Mirror.” The book was
handsomely published in three volumes, and
dedicated to Edward Everett. For an edition
of 1,200 copies Willis was paid £300, reserving
to himself the copyright; and as he had received
a guinea a page for the original articles, besides
what Morris gave him for their republication in
the “Mirror,” they may be said to have been
fairly profitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>These “Slingsby” papers are exceedingly
clever. With the possible exception of “Letters
from under a Bridge” and portions of
“Pencillings by the Way,” they are the best
work that Willis ever did; and they compare
well with such lighter fiction, in the way of
short tales or sketches of travel and adventure,
as has been produced in America since Willis’s
day. Whatever else they are, they are never
dull and always readable. They are not read
now only because the readers of light fiction
habitually follow the market and inquire merely
for the last thing out. Many of them were
worked over from his “American Monthly”
<i lang="la">juvenilia</i>, but his touch had grown firmer and
he had purchased experience, as his motto declared,
by his “penny of observation.” These
“Inklings” do not penetrate to the stratum of
real character, of strong passion, and of the
interplay of motives and moral relations in
which all vital fiction has its roots. Their plots
are commonly slight, their persons sketchy, their
incidents not seldom improbable, their coloring
sometimes too high. As transcripts of actual
life such stories as “Pedlar Karl,” “The Cherokee’s
Threat,” and “Tom Fane and I,” with
the easy optimism of their conclusions and their
cheerful avoidance of all the responsibilities imposed
upon the dwellers in this workaday world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
are of course misleading and false. Their air
is the air of every day, but their happenings are
those of the wildest romance. Their charm&mdash;and
they have for many old-fashioned readers a
quite decided charm&mdash;does not lie in truth to
life, but in the vivacious movement of the narrative,
the glimpses of scenery by the way, the
alternations of sentiment and gayety, neither
very profound, but each for the time sincere
and passing quickly into one another; and
finally in the style, always graceful, and in passages
really exquisite. It has recently been
announced that style is “increasingly unimportant,”
but can this be true? Not surely,
unless fiction is to become hereafter a branch
of social science and valuable only for its accurate
report of life. It will then be the novelist’s
duty to obliterate himself in his message,
and any intrusion of his personality between
the reader and the subject will be an impertinence.
But it is hard to believe that the personal
element is to lose its place in fiction and
be banished to the realm of autobiography and
lyric poetry. Style may be a purely external
part of an artist’s equipment, but it is a necessary
part all the same. A bad man or a weak
man may have it, but that does not make it
any the less indispensable for the good man
intending literature. Willis was born with it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
it showed in his manners, in his dress, in his
writing. Whatever he did was done with an
air.</p>

<p>The American parts of “Inklings,” written
for the English reader, are the best. They
reproduce for us the life of gay society, when
society was, or seemed, gayer, or at least fresher
than at present. It was the era of expansion and
hope before the financial panic of 1837. The
great waterway lately opened through the state
of New York had set people traveling. The
beauties of American lakes, forests, and rivers
were being discovered, but were as yet unhackneyed.
Lake George, The Thousand Isles, and
the St. Lawrence, did not swarm with tourists.
Nahant was still a fashionable seaside resort
and Niagara a watering-place, where people
actually went to spend months, and not a fleeting
show for bridal couples and a mill-race for
manufacturers. Saratoga, and Ballston, and
Lebanon were rival spas, the first a “mushroom
village” merely,&mdash;“the work of a lath
and plaster Aladdin,”&mdash;when Congress Hall,
with its big wooden colonnades, was in its glory.
“A relic or two of the still astonished forest
towers above the chimneys, in the shape of a
melancholy grove of firs, and five minutes’ walk
from the door, the dim old wilderness stands
looking down on the village.” In which wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
was embosomed Barhydt’s once famous
hermitage, with its ear-shaped tarn and columnar
pine shafts, whither one resorted for trout dinners,
and where “the long, soft mornings, quiet
as a shadowy elysium, on the rim of that ebon
lake were as solitary as a melancholy man could
desire.”</p>

<p>This newness in life at the Springs, this background
of primitive wilderness against which
the drives and dances and piazza promenades
of the fashionable frequenters were projected,
has long since disappeared, and with it has gone
a certain old school exclusiveness which once
marked the society at American baths. That
society, if not more aristocratic than at present,
was at all events more select, simply by
virtue of being smaller. Fewer people were in
the habit of going into the country in summer,
and fashionable circles in the cities were not so
large but that “the best people” from all over
the States might know each other at least by
name. A reigning belle or a distinguished beau
had a national reputation. Southern planters
brought their families to Northern resorts and
supplied an element which has been missed
since the war.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the fourteen millions of inhabitants in the
United States,” Willis explains, “there are precisely
four authenticated and undisputed aristocratic families.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
There is one in Boston, one in New York,
one in Philadelphia, and one in Baltimore. With
two hundred miles’ interval between them, they agree
passably, and generally meet at one or another of
the three watering-places of Saratoga, Ballston, or
Lebanon. Their meeting is as mysterious as the
process of crystallization, for it is not by agreement.
As it is not known till the moment they arrive, there
is, of course, great excitement among the hotel-keepers
in these different parts of the country, and a village
that has ten thousand transient inhabitants one
summer, has, for the next, scarcely as many score.
The vast and solitary temples of Pæstum are gay in
comparison with these halls of disappointment.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is, for the most part, the life of this society
which Willis so engagingly portrays in the
“Slingsby” sketches. His heroes are devil-may-care
young fellows, who wander about from one
fashionable resort to another, composing love
verses, flirting, dancing, eloping, or assisting at
elopements. It was the era of the buck or
beau, a joyous, flamboyant creature who wore
figured waistcoats, was a knowing whip, danced
with vigor, loved pink champagne, serenaded
the ladies, was gallant in speech, dashing and
confident in bearing, and never in the least
<i lang="fr">blasé</i>.</p>

<p>This freshness and youthfulness, this air of
stir, adventure, excitement, hope, which was impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
upon American life, books, and society
of that date are reflected from Willis’s sparkling
pages and give them even a sort of historical
interest, apart from their claims as literature.
There is a breath of morning wind in
them. With the homelier side of life he had
little concern, and his writing lacks gravity and
simplicity. Whenever he grows serious, it is to
grow sentimental. “F. Smith” is perhaps the
most artistic of these sketches, and the most
representative of its author’s talent, in its quick
interchange of poetic description, bright dialogue,
light, malicious humor, and natural sentiment;
neither mood in excess, nor dwelt on long
enough to fatigue. It is a trifling episode&mdash;the
caprice of a summer belle at Nahant. Its
hero is the same “gentle monster” who reappears
in many of the “Inklings”&mdash;in “Edith
Linsey,” “The Gypsy of Sardis,” and “Niagara,”
a Green Mountain Frankenstein and Quixote
in one, absent-minded and uncouth of
aspect, but with a soul filled with enthusiasm
for beauty and a delicate, chivalrous devotion to
women. He is half hero and half butt, and
introduced as a constant foil to Slingsby, the
dandy exquisite and man of the world.</p>

<p>“Edith Linsey” was the most ambitious of
the American sketches. It was a novel in outline,
and had an original plot, the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
passion of a young student for a girl who is
thought to be dying of consumption, and whose
disease has imparted an exaltation to her feelings,
and a nervous, spiritual intensity to her
thoughts. The anti-climax comes when she unexpectedly
recovers her health, and with it her
worldly ambitions, and coolly jilts her quondam
lover. There are passages in “Edith Linsey”&mdash;particularly
in the scenes between the lovers
in the library&mdash;of unusual thoughtfulness, eloquence,
and emotional depth, but the story is
loosely put together, and interrupted by digressions,
and in the latter part of it the author
seemed more concerned to deliver himself of
college reminiscences and descriptions of scenery
than to carry on his narrative with a firm hand.</p>

<p>“The Gypsy of Sardis” was the best of the
European sketches, and had a very moving,
though slightly melodramatic, conclusion. It
was a more highly finished study of Eastern
scenery and life than Willis had had leisure to
give in his “Pencillings.” A comparison of the
two shows from what slight hints he worked up
the romance,&mdash;a momentary glimpse of a gypsy
girl at a tent door, and of an Arab in the slave
market at Stamboul, a ride up the Valley of
Sweet Waters, and a morning in the shop of
old Mustapha, the perfumer. “Love and Diplomacy”
and “The Revenge of the Signor Basil”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
were less successful, because more remote from
their author’s experience. He had not the kind
of imagination necessary to transport him into
alien characters and situations. His fancy required
some contact with its object before it
would take off the electric spark.</p>

<p>Willis’s English had many excellent qualities.
It was crisp, clean cut, pointed, nimble on the
turn. He was good at a quotation, deftly
brought in, unhackneyed, and never too much
of it, a single phrase or sentence or half a line
of verse maybe. There is a perpetual twinkle
or ripple over his style, like a quaver in music,
which sometimes fatigues. Is the man never
going to forget himself and say a thing plainly?
the reader asks. But the verbal prettinesses and
affectations which disfigured his later prose do
not abound in his earlier and better work. He
had at all times, however, a feminine fondness
for italics and exclamations, and his figures had
a daintiness which displeased severe critics.
Thus: “The gold of the sunset had glided up
the dark pine-tops and disappeared, like a ring
taken slowly from an Ethiop’s finger.” “As
much salt as could be tied up in the cup of a
large water-lily” is an instance of his superfine
way of putting things. He likened Daniel Webster’s
forehead, among the heads at a Jenny
Lind concert, to “a massive magnolia blossom, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
heavy for the breeze to stir, splendid and silent
amid fluttering poplar leaves.” The “crushed
orange blossom, clinging to one of the heels” of
Ernest Clay’s boots, was a touch which greatly
amused Thackeray. And others have been
amused by the fantastic headings which he invented
for certain columns in the “Home Journal”:
“Sparklings of Tenth Waves: or Bits
Relished in Recent Readings,” “Breezes from
Spice Islands, passed in the Voyage of Life,”
and the like, which read like the title of a sixteenth
century pamphlet. An old lady in Hartford
used to say that “Nat Willis ought to go
about in spring, in sky-blue breeches, with a
rose-colored bellows to blow the buds open.”
It is remarkable with what consent all who have
had occasion to characterize Willis’s diction hit
upon the metaphor of champagne. “The wine
of Bacon’s writings,” said Dr. Johnson, “is a
dry wine.” The wine of Willis’s writings was
certainly a <i lang="de">Schaumwein</i>. It had not the rich,
still glow of burgundy, but a fizz and an up-streaming
of golden bubbles, and when the spirit
had effervesced the residue, as in his later writings,
was rather flat.</p>

<p>During his stay abroad he made a few other
contributions to literature which have not yet
been mentioned. Among these were some miscellaneous
papers in the “Mirror”: “Notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
from a Scrap Book” and “Fragments of Rambling
Impressions,” portions of which he afterwards
republished in “Ephemera.” Also a short
tale of no value, “The Dilemma,” from which
he rescued the verses “To Ermengarde” for
his collected poems. He contributed to the
London “Athenæum” for January and February,
1835, a series of four articles on American
literature, which do not appear in his “Complete
Works.” That pioneer of literature in the West,
the Rev. Timothy Flint, some time editor of the
“Cincinnati Monthly Review,” author of a novel
called “Francis Berrian,” and of a work on the
Mississippi Valley, had agreed to supply the
required papers, but he having left New York
for Louisiana Territory, and failed to come to
time, Willis was invited to take his place. He
wrote the articles hastily, though he asserted
that he had “read the productions of two hundred
poets and seventy-two prose writers whose
works have been printed in America since the
settlement of New England.” He made no approach
to an exhaustive treatment of the subject,
but gave a number of graphic personal sketches
of American authors, one in particular, of Channing
as a pulpit orator, which excited Lady
Byron’s interest, as has been mentioned, and
another of Cooper, whom he indignantly defended
against the slanders of a portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
American press. The literary judgments are
not always sound (Poe said that Willis had
good taste, but was not a good critic), but they
were the current opinions of the day rather than
of Willis individually. They were in the air.
Thus he pronounces Bryant’s “Evening Wind”
the best thing he had written, and prefers Percival
to Bryant, saying that he is “the most
interesting man in America. He has not written
anything equal to the ‘Evening Wind’ of
Bryant, but his birthright lies a thousand leagues
higher up Parnassus.” Timothy Flint afterwards
supplemented these papers by a dozen of
his own, which amply made up in heaviness for
any want of ballast in Willis’s, and were full
of “general views,” which, if not correct, were
harmless because unreadable. Willis’s “Athenæum”
articles first introduced the English public
to “The Culprit Fay,” long passages of which
he gave from a manuscript in his possession, the
poem having not as yet appeared in print. Miss
Mitford, who took a warm interest in American
literature, wrote him a note of thanks on the
publication of this series, praising it in the highest
terms.</p>

<p>It appears by a letter to Willis from Carl
August, Freiherr von Killinger, dated Carlsruhe,
April 13, 1836, that some of the “Inklings”
had already attained to the honors of translation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
The Freiherr, it seems, was engaged in translating
“Pencillings” also, and wanted material for
a biographical notice.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To the author of the ‘Slingsby Papers,’” he wrote,
“It is, perhaps, flattering to hear that his ‘Lunatic,’
his ‘Incidents on the Hudson,’ ‘Adventures on the
Green Mountains,’<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> his ‘Niagara and So Forth,’ etc.,
etc., which I had translated into a little periodical of
mine, or, rather, a choice collection of interesting articles
from English periodicals and annuals, have been
read with much interest, and repeatedly been reprinted
in Germany.… I could wish to be favored
by you with some biographical notices <em>of your own</em>
in token, as it were, of your consentment to my translatory
attempt.”</p>

1836-1845.<br />
<span class="smaller">GLENMARY&mdash;THE CORSAIR&mdash;THE NEW MIRROR.</span></h2>

<p>Willis was now fully committed to the profession
of letters, but he wished to connect it
with foreign residence, if possible. His sojourn
abroad had been pleasant and successful, and
when he sailed for home it was with a strong expectation
of returning before long to the Old
World in some diplomatic capacity. This hope
he did not cease to entertain for several years.
In a letter to Mrs. Skinner, written from Niagara
October 12, 1836, he said that he had missed the
secretaryship to France by a hand’s-breadth, and
that he wanted the next diplomatic mission that
turned up; that the climate of the United States
did not agree either with him or with Mrs. Willis;
that he was constantly subject to the rheumatism,
etc. During the winter of 1836-37,
while in Washington, he made interest to secure
the post of secretary of legation at St. Petersburg,
with the view of writing a book on Russia,
but Mr. Dallas, the newly-appointed minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to that country, had promised the place to a
kinsman. Later, in a letter to Mrs. Willis at
Glenmary, written from Boston, where he had
just met Sumner and Longfellow and was about
to dine with the latter, he speaks of a letter
from a friend who says that the President had
told him that “no young man in Washington
had impressed him so favorably. It <em>looks</em> like
going abroad,” he adds, “and not for six or
nine months merely.” This letter is dated simply
“February,” but was written, probably, in
1842, during Tyler’s administration. To the
same year, doubtless, may be referred another,
dated at New York, July 9th, in which he speaks
of having made the rounds of the men-of-war in
the harbor with John Tyler, the President’s son,
“who seems very much my friend,” and of being
invited to dinner by Dakin, to meet Tyler, Halleck,
and Bryant. “A politician,” he says, tells
him that he will be appointed abroad soon.
These hopes were all doomed to disappointment,
and to the end of his career his pen was destined
to be his best reliance.</p>

<p>The first few months after his return to America
were spent in visiting his home and friends,
and in presenting his young English bride to her
new relatives. He stayed some time at the Astor
House, in New York, then newly opened under
the hosting of the genial Stetson, and regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
as the greatest wonder on the continent in the
way of metropolitan caravansaries. On September
20th he signed an agreement with the agent
of George Virtue, the London publisher, to furnish
the letterpress for a big illustrated work on
American scenery, the drawings for which were
to be supplied by Bartlett, the English artist, who
was then in America for the purpose. The work
was to come out in monthly numbers, each containing
four plates and eight pages of letterpress,
and Willis was to receive fifteen guineas
a number. The first installment, containing descriptions
of twenty drawings, was to be ready
November 1st. It was in pursuance of this
agreement that Willis went to Niagara in the
autumn of 1836, retracing ground which he had
visited eight years before. A part of the winter
of 1836-37 and the early spring of 1837 he
passed in Washington, whence he contributed
to the “Mirror” the four letters afterwards
included in “Sketches of Travel.” He found
Washington society agreeable, and Mrs. Willis
was greatly admired and became an especial
favorite with Henry Clay. But the national
capital was then a raw, straggling town, built,
said Willis, “to please nobody on earth but a
hackney coachman.” It had not begun to grow
up to the ambitious plan on which it was projected,
and there was a ludicrous contrast between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the wide, radiating avenues, with their
imposing public buildings scattered here and
there, and the wastes between, dotted at intervals
with naked brick houses or mean negro
cabins. The large shifting population, which
fled as soon as Congress rose, lodged uncomfortably
in hotels and boarding-houses. In short,
Washington was a dismal place to live in. Willis
set his practiced observation at work to describe
the picturesque and humorous social aspects
of this unfinished city. He never took
more than the most casual interest in politics,
but he lounged about the rotunda and lobbies of
the Capitol, climbed up into the stifling galleries
of the old House and Senate chambers, whence
the ladies’ toilets could be observed, though the
voices of speakers on the floor, owing to the
acoustic defects in the building, reached the ear
“as articulate as water from a narrow-necked
bottle.” He was present at Van Buren’s inauguration,
went to a levee at the White House, and
to a dinner with Power the comedian, at which
several Indian chiefs were present who behaved
in an extraordinary manner. In the summer of
1837 he traveled about with Bartlett, who was
making his sketches for “American Scenery.”
In the course of these peregrinations he found a
lovely spot on the banks of Owego Creek near
its junction with the Susquehanna, which so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
took his fancy that he decided to pitch his tent
there. He bought from his college friend Pumpelly,
who lived near by, a domain of some two
hundred acres, which he named Glenmary, in
honor of his wife, and there in the fall of 1837
he set up his household gods. In his paper on
“The Four Rivers,” contributed to one of the
September “Mirrors” of that year, he thus announces
his discovery:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Owego Creek should have a prettier name, for
its small vale is the soul and essence of loveliness.
A meadow of a mile in breadth, fertile, soft, and
sprinkled with stately trees, furnishes a bed for its
swift windings; and from the edge of this new
Tempé, on the southern side, rise three steppes or
natural terraces, over the highest of which the forest
rears its head, and looks in upon the meeting of the
rivers; while down the sides, terrace by terrace, leap
the small streamlets from the mountain springs, forming
each again its own smaller dimple in this loveliest
face of Nature.… Here would I have a home!
Give me a cottage by one of these shining streamlets,
upon one of these terraces that seem steps to
Olympus, and let me ramble over these mountain
sides, while my flowers are growing and my head silvering
in tranquil happiness.”</p>

</div>

<p>In this secluded Arcadia his Penates had rest
for five years, and hence he wrote his “À l’Abri,
or the Tent Pitched,” contributed to the “Mirror”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
as “Letters from under a Bridge,” the
first one appearing July 7, 1838. This is Willis’s
happiest book, and reflects the happiest part
of his life. There was a side of him which
turned gladly to rural repose and simple household
pleasures. He imagined it to be “the kind
of life best suited to his disposition as well as to
his better nature,” and it had at the time the
zest of novelty. For the last five years he had
been a vagabond “in the gayest circles of the
gayest cities in the world.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is a curious fact,” he writes, “I have
learned for the first time in this wild country; that,
as the forest is cleared, new springs rise to the surface
of the ground, as if at the touch of the sunshine.…
You have yourself been in your day, dear
doctor, ‘a warped slip of wilderness,’ and will see
at once that there lies in this ordinance of nature a
beautiful analogy to certain moral changes that come
in upon the heels of more cultivated and thoughtful
manhood. There is no divining-rod whose dip shall
tell us at twenty what we shall most relish at thirty.…
You can scarce understand with what pleasure
I find this new spring in my path, the content with
which I admit the conviction that, without effort or
self-denial, the mind will slake its thirst and the heart
be satisfied with but the waste of what lies so near
us.”</p>

</div>

<p>The “dear doctor” to whom these letters were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
addressed was Dr. T. O. Porter, with whom their
author afterwards formed a literary partnership.
The little bridge under which they were written,
with its stone seat, its “floor of running water,”
its nest of swallows, and its diminutive fresh-water
lobster&mdash;which reminded Willis of Talleyrand&mdash;deserves
remembering with Pope’s
famous grotto at Twickenham. Like Cowley,
Willis acknowledged himself fond of little
things. He disliked the ocean and great rivers,&mdash;though
he finally came to live on the banks
of one. He loved small streams and narrow
valleys. The lawny, homelike scenery of the
Owego was just suited to his taste. Above all
things in nature, he delighted in running water,
which had an affinity with his own lively and
sparkling temper. “À l’Abri” was, and remains,
a thoroughly enjoyable book, chatty, pleasantly
digressive, and filled with sunshine and the air
of out-doors. It must be confessed that Willis
was something of a cockney in the presence of
great Nature. He viewed her more as a landscape
gardener than as a naturalist. He had not
the intense passion for her, the rapt communion
with her, of elect spirits like Wordsworth and
Thoreau. She furnished him rather with a hundred
pretty and playful analogies, a hundred
texts for little sermons on cheerfulness and content,
in which he rode his fancy sometimes too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
far and let his sentiment answer too quickly to
trifling provocations. He must have been but an
amateurish farmer, too, ordering his breakfast
served under a balsam fir, and selling his crops
“for the oddity of the sensation.” Naturally, except
in literary harvests, his farm did not pay,
though he was always exclaiming with grateful
surprise at the bounty of nature in yielding him
actual buckwheat, in addition to the health,
amusement, and moral lessons derived in the
process of cultivating that interesting grain. One
suspects that he grew more flowers of speech
than any grosser product from his two hundred
acres. If the crows ate his corn in the blade, he
merely philosophized, “Think what times we live
in, when even the crows are obliged to anticipate
their income!” If the red heifer chewed up a
lace cape bleaching on the lawn, he humorously
excused the heifer on account of the drought.
If the boys reported that the deer were browsing
in troops on his buckwheat, by the light of the
moon, he answered, “Let them!” One is reminded
by this last discouragement to agriculture
that Owego was still in the backwoods. Some
of the most interesting passages in the letters
describe the wild life of the lumbermen, whose
rafts glided past the Glenmary meadows “like a
singing and swearing phantom of an unfinished
barn,” and whose fires by night lit up the bends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of the Susquehanna, where their huge flotillas
lay moored. Willis once descended the river on
the top of a freshet in a steamboat of light
draught, but his usual way of coming and going
was by stage over very rough roads, the Erie railway
having not as yet penetrated those solitudes.
Another picturesque feature of the neighborhood
were the forest fires, the “blazing and innumerable
pillars swept by the wind till they
stood in still and naked redness, while the eye
could see far into their depths.” This phenomenon
furnished a vivid description for his story,
“The Picker and Piler,” contributed to the
“Corsair” of March 16, 1839, and to the April
number of the “New Monthly” for the same
year, the plot of which seems to have been furnished
him by Rand, the portrait painter, to
whom Willis sat in London in 1835, and who
regaled him during the sittings with stories of
wild adventure. Willis kept up communication
with the great world by frequent trips to New
York, and by frequent visits from his metropolitan
friends to Glenmary. Neither was he by
any means cut off from civilization at home.
He explains to the doctor in one of his letters
that Owego, two miles away, and even the village
of Canewana, a mile nearer, are within the
latitude of silver forks and their accompanying
vanities, morning calls, cards, dinner giving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
champagne, and French bonnets. R. H. Stoddard,
the poet, who visited Glenmary in the fall
of 1841, with Mr. Mackay, a congressman from
New York, has given a pleasant reminiscence of
his pilgrimage, from which I quote the following
interior:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The cottage,” he says, “had within it and about
it the evidences of a subtle, nice, clear refinement; of
a thought that, even out of the solitude of a rural life,
could frame the pleasant things that make the four
and twenty hours turn to soft and kindly ways.…
Mr. Willis opened the door, received us cordially;
and we found, in his conversation and in such observation
of all around us as a guest might in propriety
make, the hours of the evening as brilliant in-doors
as without. That thoroughly well-bred lady, so unpretending
and gentle, was at the table; at her feet,
a large greyhound. On the side table stood a large
tulip-shaped vase of stained glass, whose burden was,
of course, bright flowers. There was everywhere
copious evidence that it was a home for literature.
The books were abundant and were gayly set.…
And there was a miniature of lovely Mrs. Willis. It
was painted by Saunders, who had been a pet of the
King of Hanover. His exquisite work deserved the
smile of royalty and, what is better, of beauty.
Amidst such scenes and the conversation which came
of such associations, our night went on. We left the
lawn of Glenmary with the memories of a night of
romance.… Mr. Willis belonged to a past school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of men. He had the ways and tastes of a more
isolated and restricted society than belongs to our
day, when fortunes are fusing men and manners
into one great glittering ball that rolls through the
year, before us and over us; but Mr. Willis&mdash;whether
in his early days, when the prince regent ruled, or
in our day, when we all rule, monarchs of ephemera&mdash;was
an author whose writings have added to what
Doctor Johnson calls ‘the gayety of mankind.’ He
believed them better and higher and more philosophical
than this; and I believe there was truth and
right in his thought.”</p>

</div>

<p>The “Letters from Under a Bridge” are so
heartsome in feeling and so much mellower and
more leisurely in style than Willis’s later work,
that one naturally speculates, in reading them,
as to what might have been the effect upon his
literary product had fortune granted his wish,
to be allowed to end his days at Glenmary.
Would study and the quiet of nature have ripened
it to something deeper and richer than
anything that he has left? Or would he have
grown rusty with absence from the stir of cities
and the gay society that had hitherto seemed
his congenial element? It is impossible to answer
this question with confidence. Undoubtedly
his later work would have been other and better
than it was if he had had the time to select
and condense. He would have written more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and scribbled less. But whether he would ever
have excelled the best parts of his earlier writings
is doubtful. His talent was of the kind
which discipline does not always improve. It
was the expression of his temperament, fresh,
facile, spontaneous, but impatient of continuance.
He was best at a dash&mdash;a sketch, or a
short tale. His gift was of the sort that shows
more gracefully in youth than age. <i lang="la">Idem manebat
neque idem decebat.</i> It is not improbable
that, even under the most favoring conditions,
he would have kept on writing Jottings,
Loiterings, Hurrygraphs, etc., lacking, as he
evidently did, the power of construction required
for a large and serious work. But this
speculation is perhaps an idle one. Whether
or not it lay in his nature to sing or to say
that “something” of which Ben Jonson tells,
“that must and shall be sung high and aloof,”
fate denied him the proof. His necessities
drove him back to the city and the editor’s
chair, to write hastily and incessantly for a
livelihood. Possibly the finer work might have
shaped itself in silence, but “not in these
noises.” Meanwhile his present content found
utterance in his “Reverie at Glenmary,”&mdash;a
single breath of gratitude to God,&mdash;the most
sincerely devout of all his religious poems, and
pathetic when one reflects how soon the sheltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
happiness for which it gives thanks was to
pass away.</p>

<p>Not long after his return to America, he had
begun to try his hand at play writing. The
“Mirror” of August 19, 1837, gave passages
from a five act tragedy that he had lately completed,
“Bianca Visconti, or the Heart Overtasked,”
with the announcement that it was to
be acted at the Park Theatre on the 24th
instant. It was founded upon the life of
Francesco Sforza, a soldier of fortune in the
fourteenth century, who obtained the hand of
Bianca, daughter to the Duke of Milan, and
thereby succeeded to the duchy. The play was
composed expressly for Josephine Clifton, a
popular actress of some talent, and of great
physical force and beauty of the large, queenly
type, who took the part of the heroine. The
<i lang="fr">rôle</i> of Pasquali, “a whimsical poet,” was written
for Harry Placide, a favorite player in his
generation, whose “Grandfather Whitehead”
and other impersonations, humorous or pathetic,
are still affectionately remembered by old play-goers.
When this tragedy was published in the
spring of 1839, with some changes in the fifth
act, the “Mirror” declared that its success
upon the stage had been complete. This was
an overstatement, but whatever partial success
or qualified failure it may have met with on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
first representation, Willis felt sufficiently encouraged
to persevere in his dramatic experiments.
In a private letter from New York,
December 15, 1838, he said that Colman had
just given him $300 for an edition of “Bianca,”
which he considered a good price, as Epes
Sargent had sold his “Velasco” for $60. Wallack,
he continues, who managed the National,
the rival theatre to the Park, was full of admiration
of it, and was coming to see the whole
play rehearsed. Willis was going to charge
him $1,000 for the use of it, and a benefit
which, he calculated, would be equal to from
$500 to $700 more. On the 1st of September,
1837, just after the first representation of
“Bianca” at the Park, Willis entered into an
agreement with its manager, Turner Merritt, by
which the latter agreed to pay him $1,000, one
year from date, provided he should write a
comedy for Miss Clifton, pronounced successful
by her after three months’ acting. In pursuance
of this agreement, he had ready in two
months “The Betrothal,” a comedy, which was
announced in the “Mirror” of November 25th
as to be acted at the Park on the Monday following.
The notice added that the play would
probably take with the public, as it had pleased
the actors,&mdash;a good criterion. “The Betrothal,”
however, was unequivocally damned, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to Willis’s mortification, though not to his permanent
discouragement. The text of this play
was never published, nor was that of another
comedy, “Imei, the Jew,” with which he was
busy in January, 1839, and of which he seems
to have finished only a few scenes. Rumors
were in circulation that Willis had sued Miss
Clifton for failing to complete the engagement
in the matter of “The Betrothal,” but these
were officially contradicted in the “Mirror.”
He had better luck with another comedy, successively
entitled “Dying for Him,” “The
Usurer Matched,” and “Tortesa the Usurer,”
based on the Florentine story of Genevra
d’Amori and written with more care than
his two previous attempts. He prepared the
way for its representation by printing four installments
of it in the “Mirror;” and about a
year after the first of these appeared it was
put on at the National, April 8, 1839, with
Wallack cast for Tortesa, the principal character.
It ran four times the first week, and
kept the stage to the 20th, “being received,”
said the “Mirror,” “with acclamations by one
of the most crowded and fashionable audiences
ever assembled within the walls of a theatre.”
In spite of this glowing language, “Tortesa”
seems to have had a <i lang="fr">succès d’estime</i> merely.
Wallack had agreed to pay the author one half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the proceeds of the fourth, ninth, thirteenth, and
eighteenth nights, after deducting $300 each
night for expenses. If it was produced in England,
Willis was to have one third of the proceeds
of the fourth, eighth, and twelfth performances
there. Wallack did bring it out
at the Surrey Theatre in London, in August of
this same year. Willis was in England at the
time and wrote to Dr. Porter that it had had
“a splendid run&mdash;crammed houses every night.”
It shared the honors of the “first night” with
Willis’s old adversary, Captain Marryat, whose
“Phantom Ship” was the afterpiece. All this
brought the author nothing but empty glory, as
Wallack was distressed for money and could
not afford to pay him his one third share of the
profits. “So I gave it up,” wrote Willis, “and
he pocketed the whole. By the way,” he adds,
“I have two more nights at the National which
I authorize you to look after and receive for me.
The thirteenth and eighteenth representations
remain for me. Will you see if you can get
Kean or Vandenhoff in for Angelo on those
nights? I have seen a great deal of Kean
since I have been here, and he is truly a good
fellow and a great actor. He breakfasted with
us a day or two ago and Mary was very much
interested that he should do well in America.
I have given Vandenhoff ‘Bianca’ for himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and daughter to play in America. She is a fine,
handsome girl, but I have not seen her play.”</p>

<p>These two plays of Willis did not add many
leaves to his laurels. His genius was undramatic;
in his stories the dramatic element is
not the most pronounced. Both “Bianca” and
“Tortesa” have passages which are good as
poetry or declamation, and here and there occur
bits of spirited dialogue; but in general the
characters are only half vitalized, the situations
are not firmly grasped and presented, and the
language is stilted. In short, they are book
plays merely, with nothing to distinguish them
from the numerous experiments of other American
literary gentlemen who have essayed to
feed the stage with manuscripts from their
library tables. In “Bianca Visconti” the main
situation&mdash;the heroine’s connivance at her
brother’s murder, in order that her husband
might become Duke of Milan&mdash;is strongly
imagined but feebly carried out. One cannot
help thinking how Victor Hugo, for instance,
would have dealt with this motive. “Tortesa
the Usurer” seems to be made up of hints from
Shakespeare. The hero has some slight resemblance
to Shylock; the heroine drinks a sleeping
potion, like Juliet, to escape an odious marriage;
and in the last act, which is constructed
with some skill, she stands in the frame of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
picture, like Hermione in “Winter’s Tale,”
though with a different purpose.</p>

<p>Willis’s official connection with the “New
York Mirror” had stopped with the termination
of his “Pencillings,” and after January 16, 1836,
his name ceased to appear at the head of the
editorial column. His contributions, however,
as we have seen, went on, and included not only
“Letters from Under a Bridge,” but poems and
miscellaneous correspondence, besides a half
dozen of stories, afterwards collected in “Romance
of Travel.” The verse contributions
were added to the American edition of “Melanie,”
1837, which contained a number of things
written since the appearance of the English
edition two years previous. Notable among
these were “Lines on Leaving Europe,” “To a
Face Beloved,”&mdash;both of which have been mentioned,&mdash;“To
Ermengarde,” and a song-like
little piece entitled “Spring,” the opening lines
of which are especially Willisy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The Spring is here, the delicate-footed May,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With its slight fingers full of leaves and flowers;</div>
<div class="verse">And with it comes a thirst to be away,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Wasting in wood-paths its voluptuous hours.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are evidences in Willis’s private correspondence,
about this time, of some coolness between
himself and General Morris, which appears
to have originated, or perhaps to have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
expression in a series of three letters signed
“Veritas,” written from London and printed in
the “Mirror,” in the fall of 1838. These letters,
after taking the “Mirror” to task for misleading
the American public by the false pictures of
London society given in the “Pencillings,” proceeded
to set its readers right, in a series of the
coarsest and most slanderous little biographies
of English men and women of letters, retailing
with unction all the gossip of the clubs about
Lady Blessington, Count d’Orsay, the Bulwers,
Disraeli, Mrs. Norton, Miss Landon, Fraser, and
many others. Some of these had been Willis’s
friends; others he had never met; but he wrote
an indignant rejoinder to the “Mirror” of November
10th, denying, out and out, many of the
lies in “Veritas’s” communication, and explaining
away some of the misrepresentations and exaggerations.
This letter Morris prefaced with an
editorial note in which he said that he had been
much censured on account of the “Pencillings,”
and, therefore, “the object of these letters was to
disabuse the public mind in this country of what
seemed to the author a wrong and injurious impression
with regard to the position in English
society of certain distinguished but unworthy
characters, whose example and many of whose
writings are of a pernicious tendency. With
one or two exceptions, we believe that our correspondent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
has merely stated well attested facts.”
One of these exceptions was the slander upon
Miss Landon, for printing which Morris apologized.
This partial indorsement of “Veritas”
by the editor naturally displeased Willis; and
naturally, too, he was pleased by an answer to
it by Dr. Porter, in the “Spirit of the Times,”
which was then edited by his brother, William
T. Porter, “the tall son of York,” and with
which Dr. Porter himself was editorially connected.
“The Skylight letter,” Willis writes to
the latter, “was capitally done, and the ‘Mirror’
was touched on all its sore places to a
charm. My brother was in New York just after
and called at the office, and the fury the General
was in will amuse him for the next six
months. Morris called you a gallipot, said it
was a poor article, and will hurt your paper, and
all that; but sits down and writes <em>me</em> a most
affectionate letter of four foolscap pages, denying
all possible thought of me in the London
matter, and swearing he was my defender and
best friend.” Elsewhere in his correspondence
with Dr. Porter, Willis expresses some doubts
as to the sincerity of Morris’s friendship, and
seems to suspect that it was more than half policy
and a desire to exploit him. It does not appear
that this little misunderstanding ever came
to a breach. The “Mirror” continued most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
courteous in its tone towards Willis, and its editor
became and remained, till his death, one of
his closest friends. But for a time Willis felt
inclined to draw off, and to find some other avenue
through which to address his public. This
feeling took shape in December, 1838, in his acceptance
of a proposal from Dr. Porter to join
him in establishing a weekly paper. The “Corsair,”
which was the outcome of this arrangement,
was, like “Brother Jonathan” and the
“New World,” one of the crop of weeklies which
sprang up in the wake of the first transatlantic
steamers. On May 19, 1838, the Great Western,
the first steam vessel that had crossed the
ocean, weighed anchor in New York harbor for
her return trip. A company of gentlemen,
among whom were Chevalier Wikoff and General
Morris, were on board by invitation and accompanied
the ship as far as Sandy Hook, where
they were taken off by a pilot. It may perhaps
have occurred to the general at the time, that
here was what would work a change in the conditions
of American journalism. It was now
possible to get the freshest supply from the London
literary market within a fortnight, and the
news of Europe before it was cold. Willis and
Porter proposed frankly to live on the plunder
of this foreign harvest; and since there was no
international copyright, to raise the black flag,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and take reprisals wherever they could find
them. In a letter to his intending partner, dated
at Owego, Christmas eve, 1838, he proposed to
call their venture the “Pirate,” and sent the
following draft of a prospectus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">THE PIRATE,<br />
A GAZETTE OF LITERATURE, FASHION, AND NOVELTY.</p>

<p>T. O. Porter and N. P. Willis propose to issue
weekly, in the city of New York, a paper of the above
designation and character. It is their design, as editors,
to present as amusing a paper as can be made
from the current wit, humor, and literature of the
world; to give dramatic criticisms without fear or favor;
to hold up the age in its fashions, its eccentricities,
and its amusements; to take advantage, in short,
of the privilege assured to us by our piratical law of
copyright; and in the name of American authors
(for our own benefit) “convey” to our columns, for
the amusement of our readers, the cream and spirit
of everything that ventures to light in France, England,
and Germany. As to original American productions,
we shall, as the publishers do, take what we
can get for nothing (that is good), holding, as the
publishers do, that while we can get Boz and Bulwer
for a thank-ye or less, it is not pocket-wise to
pay much for Halleck and Irving.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If anybody says the name is undignified,” writes
Willis, “tell them there are very few dignified people
in the world, and still <em>fewer lovers</em> of dignity, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the Lord, we must live by the <em>many</em>. Then again we
want a root, a reason, a rail, a runner to start upon,
and this bloody copyright will answer the purpose.
People will say, ‘Why, damme, Willis can’t get paid
for his books because the law won’t protect him, so
he has hauled his wind, and joined the people that
robbed him.’”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Willis felt very bitterly the absence of an international
copyright. By the act of 1838, the
English Parliament, acting in self-defense, had
refused to protect any longer the literary property
of American authors, until America should
have the decency to reciprocate. This cut double
upon the American author. It deprived him of
any gain from the circulation of his writings in
England, and it discouraged native literature
by flooding this country with cheap reprints of
English books, for the copy of which the American
publisher paid nothing. The former loss
would not have been serious to many American
writers at that date, possibly not to so very
many even now. But England had been Willis’s
best market, literary work in America was
wretchedly paid, and he saw starvation staring
him in the face.</p>

<p>The “Pirate” was finally toned down into
the “Corsair,” and a prospectus which was a
modification of the one drafted by Willis in the
above letter was printed and circulated in January,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
1839. He sent one to Henry Clay, and
begged him to mention the “Corsair” in his
argument on the copyright, as a good comment
on the state of the law. Mr. Clay replied in a
very polite letter, giving his views upon the copyright
question, and inclosing his subscription.
The office of the “Corsair” was in the Astor
House, No. 8 Barclay Street. The first number
was published March 15, 1839, and the last
(No. 52) March 7, 1840. At the head of the
sheet was a rakish looking craft under full sail,
and Willis led off with a truculent editorial,
“The Quarter Deck” proclaiming the policy of
the new paper. To the earlier numbers he contributed
art notes and miscellaneous chat, “The
Pencil,” “The Gallery,” “The Divan,” etc.;
two papers on autographs; a “Letter from Under
a Bridge,” a generic name that he gave to
much correspondence about this time, not comprised
in the original “Letters”; some reminiscences
of Miss Landon as “The Departed Improvisatrice,”
and a very harsh review, “Paulding
the Author Disinterred.” This last was
unlike Willis, who was almost always kind in
his notices of brother authors, and it provoked
much unfavorable comment, particularly a rejoinder
in the “Courier and Enquirer,” by Colonel
James Watson Webb, a gentleman who afterwards
fell foul of Willis in various ways. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
this article he held him up to scorn as a writer
“who revels on the cut of a coat or the ottomans
of a lady’s boudoir, and delights in the
soft shades of a glen;” and whose works were
only fit to “make the papillotes of ladies’
chambermaids.” Willis had an unaffected disrelish
for Paulding’s writings, which he thought
coarse and pointless. But the Secretary of the
Navy was an old man, whose books belonged already
to the past, and it was ungracious to disturb
his age with taunts about their obsoleteness.
One suspects, in reading this review, that its
writer had some personal grudge against the author
of “The Dutchman’s Fireside.”</p>

<p>Willis also contributed to the “Corsair” “A
Story Writ for the Beautiful,” which he described
as a “gay, off-hand tale,” and never reprinted.
It is a rather nonsensical yarn, but
has one pretty passage in it descriptive of the
end of a ball,&mdash;perhaps at Devonshire House?&mdash;where
the servants raise the balcony awnings
to let in the dawn, and the ladies walk in the
garden, “sprinkling their gloves with picking
wet roses.”</p>

<p>On May 20, 1839, Willis sailed for England
on the packet ship Gladiator. His wife accompanied
him, and, on landing, they were met by
the news that her father, General Stace, had
died a week before their arrival. This made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
their stay in England, which was protracted to
April, 1840, a sad one in many respects, and of
course a quiet one. They passed most of the
time with relatives of Mrs. Willis at Old Charlton,
Kent, after a short visit to her sister Anne,
who was married to the Rev. William Vincent,
son of the vicar of Bolney Priory, in Sussex.
Willis had his hands full of literary business
which required his presence frequently in London,
Ireland, and elsewhere. Among other
things, he had contracted with Virtue to furnish
the letterpress for an illustrated work on Canada,
and another on Ireland, uniform with the
“American Scenery.” He was to write 240
pages for each, and to be paid in all £950. By
some five or six weeks of hard work he finished
the Canadian book in August, and then started
for a tour in Ireland preparatory to writing up
its scenery. He left Mrs. Willis at Dublin,
while he recrossed to Scotland, and took in the
famous tournament at Eglintoun Castle, which
filled the land for months with its noise of preparation,
and ended in fizzle and rain-water. Of
this he gave a capital description in his letter to
the “Corsair,” “My Adventures at the Tournament.”
Mrs. Willis remained with some kinsfolk
of her mother, at Borrmount Lodge, near
Enniscorthy, County Wexford, while her husband
spent a fortnight in doing the Lakes of Killarney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and other show places in the south of the
island. He wrote to her there from Tarbert-on-the-Shannon,
September 13th:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The poverty on this side Ireland makes me sick
at the stomach. Such a God-and-man-abandoned collection
of disease and misery I never believed possible.
Death and disease seem clutching their victims
away in your very sight, and you see them struggle
and go through their last agony in the streets&mdash;unpitied.
How people can ride in carriages and wear
white gloves and smile and look happy, in this great
lazar-house, is beyond my conception. I keep my
great cloak pocket full of pence, and shut my eyes
while I give them into their skinny hands,&mdash;poor
devils!”</p>

</div>

<p>Madden sings the wrath of Campbell over this
literary undertaking of Willis: “What could
he know of Ireland? How could any American
know anything about it? Fourteen days! All
the knowledge he possesses of Ireland might
have been acquired in fourteen hours.” Willis
might have retorted by asking what a Scotchman
could know about the Valley of Wyoming. Or
he might have pointed out that, even as early as
1839, Americans had fuller sources of information
about Ireland than they found altogether
comfortable. After three weeks more of touring
in that ragged commonwealth, he returned
with his wife to England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Bolney was but twelve miles from Brighton,
where the Wallacks were staying, and while
visiting at the former place Willis had run across
country and taken dinner with them. In November
he spent a few days at Brighton, where
he lodged at the Ship Hotel, found several old
acquaintances,&mdash;Lady Stepney and Lady Georgiana
Fane among them,&mdash;and made some new
ones. At a dinner at Lady Macdonald’s he met
Charles Kemble, the actor, and Horace Smith, of
the “Rejected Addresses,” whose brother James
he had known at Lady Blessington’s four years
ago. One of Willis’s cherished plans had been
to spend the winter in Spain, a country rich in
matter for future pencillings, but this scheme
he had to forego, Ireland proving a longer job
than he had anticipated. The last day of 1839
found him still at Charlton, working four hours
a day on the book, and in January and February
he had to make another trip to Ireland,
visiting the Giant’s Causeway and other celebrated
bits of scenery in the north. Lady Georgiana
Fane had procured him a letter from her
father, the old Earl of Westmoreland, to Lord
Ebrington, the lord lieutenant of Ireland, in
which Willis was described as “a gentleman of
fortune, likely to attain to the presidency”!
He dined with Lord Ebrington at Dublin, and,
happening to be there at the time of the ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
given in honor of the queen’s wedding, he made
a letter of it for the “Corsair,” afterwards included
in “Sketches of Travel.”</p>

<p>The three books on American, Canadian, and
Irish scenery were hack work, and there is, of
course, little of personal or purely literary interest
in them. They were written, however, with
more taste and animation than the run of subscription
books of the kind. Willis was a natural
traveler, with a good eye for landscape effects,
and the best chapters are those descriptive of
spots with which he was already familiar, Niagara,
the Hudson, Trenton Falls, Saratoga, and
the like. Here he occasionally drew on his
“Inklings.” For places that he had not visited
he trusted to the narratives of former travelers,
such as President Dwight, John Bartram, and
Peter Kalm. The description of the White
Mountains was taken mainly from a friend’s
manuscript diary; and for statistics and local
legends he went to the authorities. The American
book contained, among its two hundred
and forty-two engravings, a view from Glenmary
lawn and another of Undercliff, General
Morris’s place on the Hudson. The last
gave Willis opportunity for a eulogy on his
former partner, and quotations from his songs.
“Canadian Scenery” was “lifted,” almost entire,
from the narratives of Charlevoix, Adair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Heriot, Hodgson, Murray, Talbot, Cockburn,
and other travelers and historians&mdash;of course
with ample acknowledgments. It was not so
purely descriptive as the American book, but
contained chapters on the native Indians, the
history of the settlement of the country, the
present condition of the inhabitants, sporting,
immigration, etc. In fact, there is very little
of Willis in the book. In “The Scenery and
Antiquities of Ireland” he had the assistance
of Mr. J. Sterling Coyne, who prepared the
whole of the second volume and a part of the
first, Willis’s share consisting only of descriptions
of the North of Ireland, a portion of Connemara,
the Shannon, Limerick, and Waterford.</p>

<p>Before leaving America he had arranged with
Colman for the publication of “The Tent
Pitched” (“À l’Abri”), “Tales of Five Lands”
(“Romance of Travel”), and “The Usurer
Matched.” He was to have twenty per cent.
on sales, and received $2,000 on account in advance.
Meanwhile the Longmans offered him
£200 for “Romance of Travel,” if published in
advance of the American edition. Willis wrote
to Dr. Porter, July 26, 1839, to delay the Colman
publication. “If it is printed in America
before I get the sheets here, I lose exactly
$1,000. I trust in Heaven you have not forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
my earnest injunctions on this subject. A
London publisher will buy it if a published
copy has not come over, else he may have it for
nothing.” The book was accordingly published
first in London, in January, 1840, in three volumes,
with the title “Loiterings of Travel,” and,
later in the same year, in America, as “Romance
of Travel,” in a single volume, very shabbily
printed. Virtue also paid him £50 for an English
edition of “À l’Abri,” with illustrations by
Bartlett. A fourth London edition of “Pencillings,”
with four illustrations, was coming out,
and, finally, Cunningham, Macrone’s successor,
printed an English edition of “Bianca Visconti”
and “Tortesa” as “Two Ways of Dying for a
Husband.” This was published on half profits,
and Willis expected to make about £50 from it.
Serjeant Talfourd, the author of “Ion,” wrote
him a complimentary letter on its appearance.
“My literary receipts in England this year,”
wrote Willis to Dr. Porter, on the last day of
1839, “will amount to $7,500, all gone for expenses,
back debts, etc.”</p>

<p>“Romance of Travel” was a collection of
seven stories contributed to the “Mirror,” the
“New Monthly,” and the “Corsair.” They were
crowded with duels, intrigues, disguises, escapades,
assassinations, masked balls, lost heirs,
and all the stock properties of the romancer’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
art. The view of life which they presented
was unreal to the verge of the fantastic, but
they abounded in descriptions of great elegance
and even beauty, and the narrative went trippingly
along. Willis had many of the gifts of
the born <i lang="fr">raconteur</i>. He lacked a large constructiveness,
but in the minor graces of the
story-teller he was always happy. He was skillful
in managing the <i lang="la">callida junctura</i>, good at
a start, a transition, or a finish. One must not
look in these artificial fictions for truthful delineation
of character, or expect to have his
emotions deeply stirred. The tragic incidents,
especially, fail in the time-honored Aristotelian
requirement. They are exciting enough, in a
way, but move neither pity nor terror. The high
spirits of the narrator carry his readers buoyantly
along over the bloodiest passages with
scarcely an abatement of their cheerfulness.
Willis did not take room enough to develop
character and motive to the extent required in
order to give his thick-coming events an air of
<i lang="fr">vraisemblance</i>. “This tale of many tails,” he
said of “Violanta Cesarini,” “should have been
a novel. You have in brief what should have
been well elaborated, embarrassed with difficulties,
relieved by digressions, tipped with a moral,
and bound in two volumes, with a portrait of
the author.” From this defect and from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
author’s light way of telling his stories, it followed
that the more serious of these carried no
conviction of reality to the reader’s mind. “Violanta
Cesarini” is the history of a humpbacked
artist, who turns out to be the heir to the estates
of a Roman noble, thereby supplanting his sister,
but enabling her to marry his chum, a poor artist,
with whom she was secretly in love. The
outlines of the plot were from a true story told
him by Lady Blessington, but he added the love
passages and, of course, all the particulars in
the development of the tale. “Paletto’s Bride”
was the legend of a Venetian gondolier, who
made&mdash;and as suddenly lost&mdash;a fortune in a
single night’s play, figured as a mysterious unknown
in the high society of Florence, and carried
off a titled beauty to share his home among
the lagoons. “The Bandit of Austria” was a
modification of a story related to Willis by
D’Orsay. The heroine was a Hungarian countess,
who had run off with a famous outlaw. The
latter having been killed by the Austrian police,
the lady, without wasting much time in unavailing
regrets, falls in love with the narrator’s
handsome English page (a glorified William
Michell?), and is wedded to him after a series
of extraordinary adventures. Willis worked in
here a striking description of the grotto of
Adelsberg, in which the most effective scene of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the story takes place. “Lady Ravelgold” is a
tale of English high life. The hero is a young
London banker, who proves in the end to be a
count of the Russian Empire, and the inheritor
of vast possessions in that conveniently indefinite
country. Three high-born beauties are desperately
enamored of him, among them a mother
and daughter, the latter of whom ultimately gets
him. As in “Ernest Clay,” and, in fact, in
nearly all Willis’s stories of high life, it is the
women who make love to the men. The scene
of the garden party at “Rose Eden” was suggested
by a <i lang="fr">fête champêtre</i> at Gore House, and
the delicious picture of Lady Ravelgold’s boudoir
was doubtless borrowed from the same mansion.
The high-piled luxuriance of the upholstery in
these “Romances of Travel,” their <i lang="fr">nonchalant</i>
young heroes, their jeweled and embroidered
heroines, with Aladdin-like resources in the way
of palaces, gardens, retainers, and stalactite caverns,
point to “Vivian Grey” and the other
expensive fictions of the youthful Disraeli as
Willis’s nearest models. Upon the whole, the
best story in the book is “Pasquali, the Tailor
of Venice,” which was more within the natural
compass of Willis’s talent. It has a malicious
irony that reminds one of “Beppo” and the “Decameron,”
and it is not without an undercurrent
of pathos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of his other literary preoccupations
he found time to write a series of weekly or
fortnightly letters to the “Corsair,”&mdash;“Jottings
down in London,”&mdash;a portion of which stand in
his collected writings as “Passages from an
Epistolary Journal.” They are naturally not as
fresh as the earlier “Pencillings,” though very
good foreign correspondence of an ephemeral
sort. In search of matter for these letters,
Willis went about a good deal in London. He
visited the theatres and the House of Commons,
looked up his old acquaintances of 1835, was
present at a reception to the Persian ambassadors
at Lady Morgan’s,&mdash;where he saw Mrs.
Norton again,&mdash;dined with the Nawaub of Oude,
went to a public dinner given to Macready at
the Freemasons’ Tavern,&mdash;where he sat next
Samuel Lover,&mdash;to a ball at Almack’s, and
a tournament in St. John’s Wood. Disraeli
walked home with him from a ball and said
he was going to Niagara on his wedding trip.
Willis noted some changes in England since
his first visit. Among other things William IV.
was dead and Victoria on the throne, and the
London shops had increased greatly in splendor.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting results of this
second stay in England was his meeting with
Thackeray&mdash;then a young and comparatively
unknown writer&mdash;and his engaging him as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
contributor to the “Corsair,” a stroke of journalistic
enterprise which ought to have prolonged
the life of that piratical journal, but
did not. In a private letter to Dr. Porter,
dated July 26th, Willis wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have engaged a contributor to the ‘Corsair.’
Who do you think? The author of ‘Yellowplush’
and ‘Major Gahagan.’ I have mentioned it in my
jottings, that our readers may know all about it. He
has gone to Paris, and will write letters from there,
and afterwards from London, for a guinea a <em>close
column</em> of the ‘Corsair’&mdash;cheaper than I ever
did anything in my life. I will see that he is paid
for a while to see how you like him. For myself, I
think him the very best periodical writer alive. He
is a royal, daring, fine creature, too. I take the responsibility
of it. You will hear from him soon.”</p>

</div>

<p>The mention in the jottings here referred to
appeared in the “Corsair” of August 24th.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One of my first inquiries in London was touching
the authorship of ‘The Yellowplush Papers’
and the ‘Reminiscences of Major Gahagan,’&mdash;the
only things in periodical literature, except the ‘Pickwick
Papers,’ for which I looked with any interest
or eagerness. The author, Mr. Thackeray,
breakfasted with me yesterday, and the ‘Corsair’
will be delighted, I am sure, to hear that I have engaged
this cleverest and most gifted of the magazine-writers
of London to become <i>a regular correspondent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
of the ‘Corsair.’</i> He left London for Paris the
day after, and having resided in that city for many
years, his letters thence will be pictures of life in
France, done with a bolder and more trenchant pen
than has yet attempted the subject. He will present
a long letter every week, and you will agree with me
that he is no common acquisition. Thackeray is a tall,
athletic man of about thirty-five, with a look of talent
that could never be mistaken. He has taken to literature
after having spent a very large inheritance;
but in throwing away the gifts of fortune, he has
cultivated his natural talents very highly, and is one
of the most accomplished draftsmen in England, as
well as the cleverest and most brilliant of periodical
writers. He has been the principal critic for the
‘Times,’ and writes for ‘Fraser’ and ‘Blackwood.’
You will hear from him by the first steamer after
his arrival in Paris, and thenceforward regularly.”</p>

</div>

<p>The same number contained Thackeray’s first
letter, dated at Paris, Hôtel Mirabeau, July 25,
1839, and concluding with a characteristic little
address to the editor, in which he speaks of his
feelings “in finding good friends and listeners
among strangers far, far away&mdash;in receiving
from beyond seas kind crumbs of comfort for
our hungry vanities.” These letters were signed
T. T. (Timothy Titcomb), and eight of them in
all were published in the “Corsair.” A few
appear in Thackeray’s collected works in a volume
entitled “The Paris Sketch Book,” and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of them, with a few changes, in “The Student’s
Quarter; or Paris Five and Thirty Years since,”
published by Hotten after Thackeray’s death.
Thackeray humorously alludes to this episode
in his early literary struggles in his novel of
“Philip,” the hero of which contributes a weekly
letter, signed “Philalethes,” to a fashionable
New York journal entitled “The Gazette of the
Upper Ten Thousand.” “Political treatises,”
writes the excellent Dr. Firmin to his son, “are
not so much wanted as personal news, regarding
the notabilities of London.” This description
of the “Mirror” pointed, of course, at Willis’s
authorship of the phrase, “The Upper Ten
Thousand.”</p>

<p>It may be not uninteresting to compare
Thackeray’s opinion of Willis with Willis’s
impressions of Thackeray. The author of the
“Book of Snobs” paid his respects twice, at
least, in print to the author of “Pencillings by
the Way:” once in a review of “Dashes at
Life” in the “Edinburgh” for October, 1845,
and again in an article “On an American
Traveler,” being the sixth number of “The
Proser,” contributed to the nineteenth volume
of “Punch” (1850), and occasioned by Willis’s
“People I have Met.” In both of these papers
he quizzes Willis, though not unkindly. He
laughs especially at his fashion in “Ernest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Clay,” of representing the aristocratic English
dames as all throwing themselves at the head of
the conquering young genius who writes for the
magazines.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The great characteristic of high society in England,
Mr. Willis assures us, is admiration of literary
talent. As some captain of free lancers of former
days elbowed his way through royal palaces with the
eyes of all womankind after him, so in the present
time, a man by being a famous <em>Free Pencil</em> may
achieve a similar distinction. This truly surprising
truth forms the text of almost every one of Mr. Willis’s
‘Dashes’ at English and Continental life.”</p>

<p>“That famous and clever N. P. Willis of former
days, whose reminiscences have delighted so many of
us, and in whose company one is always sure to find
amusement of one sort or the other. Sometimes it
is amusement at the writer’s wit and smartness, his
brilliant descriptions and wondrous flow and rattle of
spirits, and sometimes it is wicked amusement, and,
it must be confessed, at Willis’s own expense.…
To know a duchess, for instance, is given to very
few of us. He sees things that are not given to us
to see. We see the duchess pass by in her carriage
and gaze with much reverence on the strawberry
leaves on the panels and her Grace within; whereas
the odds are that the lovely duchess has had, at one
time or the other, a desperate flirtation with Willis
the conqueror.… He must have whole mattresses
stuffed with the blonde or raven or auburn memories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of England’s fairest daughters. When the female
English aristocracy reads this title of ‘People I
have Met,’ I can fancy the whole female peerage of
Willis’s time in a shudder: and the melancholy marchioness,
and the abandoned countess, and the heart-stricken
baroness trembling, as each gets the volume,
and asking of her guilty conscience, ‘Gracious goodness!
Is the monster going to show up <em>me</em>?’”</p>

</div>

<p>Especially does he chaff Willis about his story
of “Brown’s Day with the Mimpsons,” the
hero of which adventure, an American who is
hand in glove with noble dukes, etc., is asked
home to dinner by Mimpson, a plain, blunt
British merchant, whose wife snubs Mr. Brown,
mistaking him for a plebeian person. The latter
avenges himself by a somewhat cavalier deportment,
and by obtaining, through his dear
friend Lady X., a ticket to Almack’s for Mrs.
M.’s companion, the pretty Miss Bellamy; while
the matron herself and her haughty daughter,
who are dying for a ticket, are left out in the
cold. Thackeray remonstrates as follows with
Mr. Brown, under whose modest mask he fancies
that he sees the “features of an N. P. W. himself:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There’s a rascal for you! He enters a house, is
received coolly by the mistress, walks into chicken-fixings
in a side room, and, not content with Mimpson’s
sherry, calls for a bottle of champagne&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
for a glass of champagne, but for a bottle. He catches
hold of it and pours out for himself, the rogue, and
for Miss Bellamy, to whom Thomas (the butler) introduces
him. Come, Brown, you are a stranger and
on the dinner list of most of the patricians of May
Fair, but isn’t this <i lang="fr">un peu fort</i>, my boy? If Mrs.
Mimpson, who is described as a haughty lady, fourth
cousin of a Scotch earl, and marrying M. for his
money merely, had suspicions regarding the conduct
of her husband’s friends, don’t you see that this sort
of behavior on your part, my dear Brown, was not
likely to do away with Mrs. M.’s little prejudices?”</p>

</div>

<p>In April, 1840, Mr. and Mrs. Willis sailed
for America, taking with them Miss Bessie
Stace, a younger sister of Mrs. Willis, who was
to make them a visit at Owego. The “Corsair”
had not been a success financially, and Dr. Porter
had become discouraged and discontinued
publication in March, transferring his subscription
list to the “Albion.” Since the establishment
of the paper, a year before, Willis had
ceased his contributions to the New York “Mirror,”
and he did not resume them until the end of
1842. But meanwhile he was not left without a
market for his literary wares. Just before leaving
England he had received a letter from Mr.
J. Gregg Wilson, the publisher of “Brother
Jonathan,” a new weekly printed in New York,
with a circulation of some twenty thousand, informing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
him of the “Corsair’s” suspension, expressing
a warm admiration for his talents, and
inviting him to write the “Brother Jonathan” a
weekly letter, a column in length, for which he
promised to pay him at the highest current rates.
To this paper Willis contributed about a year
and a half, or up to September, 1841. His humorous
poem, “Lady Jane,” was published in
installments in the “Dollar,” the monthly edition
of “Brother Jonathan.” With both of
these periodicals he had a <i lang="la">quasi</i> editorial connection,
though the real editor was Mr. H. Hastings
Weld. He received similar invitations from
the two monthlies, “Graham’s Magazine” and
“Godey’s Lady’s Book,” which were paying
their contributors&mdash;among whom were nearly
all the principal writers in the country&mdash;prices
hitherto unknown to American periodicals. Willis
was paid at the rate of $50 for an article of
four printed pages of the “Lady’s Book,”&mdash;less,
no doubt, than a writer of equal reputation
could command now, but regarded as wildly
munificent in 1841. Twelve dollars a page were
the regular rates of both these magazines. “The
burst on author-land of Graham’s and Godey’s
liberal prices,” said Willis, “was like a sunrise
without a dawn.” Mr. Charles T. Congdon, in
his interesting “Reminiscences of a Journalist,”
says that “Mr. Willis was the first magazine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
writer who was tolerably well paid. At one time,
about 1842, he was writing four articles monthly
for four magazines, and receiving $100 each.”
This means an income of $4,800 a year, but the
strain required to keep up such a rate of production
must tax the powers of the readiest writer,
and it was no wonder if the product was of very
uneven excellence. The four magazines here referred
to were undoubtedly the “Mirror,” “Graham’s,”
“Godey’s,” and “The Ladies’ Companion,”
of which Mrs. Sigourney was for a
time the editor, and to which Willis contributed
in 1842 and 1843 a half dozen stories and a few
“Passages from Correspondence” and “Leaves
from a Table Book.” Two of these stories
are not found among his collected writings:
“Poyntz’s Aunt,” a Saratoga tale, which has
been mentioned before, and “Fitz Powys and
the Nun, or Diplomacy in High Life,” a very
impossible fiction, and not worth describing.
Such of the “Leaves” and “Scraps” as deserved
preserving found their way into “Ephemera.”
His contributions to “Godey’s” began
with the January number for 1842, and continued,
though with greatly diminished frequency,
till January, 1850. During the first
year he had an article in nearly every number,
most of them stories. For “Graham’s” he began
to write in January, 1843, and contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
occasionally as late as 1851. “The Marquis in
Petticoats” and “Broadway; A Sketch” were
published in 1843 in Epes Sargent’s short-lived
magazine; “The Power of an Injured Look” in
the “Gift” for 1845, an annual issued in Philadelphia.
He edited another annual, the “Opal”
for 1844, and wrote articles of various kinds for
other periodicals. During the two years and a
half from January, 1842, to June, 1844, he published,
all in all, some forty stories, collected,
with two or three exceptions, in “Dashes at Life
with a Free Pencil.” Willis was at this time,
beyond a doubt, the most popular, best paid, and
in every way most successful magazinist that
America had yet seen. He commanded the sympathy
of his readers more than any other periodical
writer of his day, and his reputation almost
amounted to fame. Colonel Higginson tells a
story, illustrating his vogue, about a solid commercial
gentleman in Boston, who, finding himself
by chance at some literary dinner or tea, is
reported to have entered into the spirit of the
occasion by saying that “he guessed Gō-ēthe
was the N. P. Willis of Germany.”</p>

<p>Willis lived at Owego till 1842, and continued
to date his letters to “Brother Jonathan,”
“Graham’s,” etc., “from under a bridge.” He
had expected something like £1,000 from General
Stace’s estate, but it yielded him nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
His publisher failed about this time, and his
arrangement with “Brother Jonathan” coming
to an end, he engaged with a Washington paper,
the “National Intelligencer,” to send it
fortnightly correspondence from New York. All
these causes combined made it necessary for him
to take up his residence in the city and to offer
Glenmary for sale; which he did with a heavy
heart, taking the public into his confidence, as
usual, in his affecting “Letter to the Unknown
Purchaser and Next Occupant of Glenmary,”
first printed in “Godey’s” for December, 1842,
and included in all subsequent editions of “Letters
from under a Bridge.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I thought to have shuffled off my mortal coil
tranquilly here; flitting at last in some company of
my autumn leaves, or some bevy of spring blossoms,
or with snow in the thaw.… In the shady depths
of the small glen above you, among the wild flowers
and music, the music of the brook babbling over
rocky steps, is a spot sacred to love and memory.
Keep it inviolate, and as much of the happiness of
Glenmary as we can leave behind stay with you for
recompense!”</p>

</div>

<p>This sacred nook&mdash;reserved from purchase&mdash;was
the spot where his own hands had broken the
snow and frozen earth to bury the little body of
his first child, a daughter, born dead December
4, 1840. The father’s grief and disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
found a voice in one of the most naturally and
simply written of his poems, “Thoughts while
making the Grave of a New-Born Child.”
On June 20, 1842, a second daughter, Imogen,
was born, his only surviving child by his first
wife. Later in the same summer he broke up his
home at Glenmary and removed to New York.
For a while he “pitched his uprooted tent” in
Brooklyn lodgings; then he went to housekeeping
for a time, and afterwards took rooms at the
Astor. When in London in 1836, Willis had
accompanied his publisher, Macrone, on a visit
to Dickens, then “a young paragraphist for the
‘Morning Chronicle,’” living in lodgings at Furnivall’s
Inn. This visit he afterwards described
in his “Ephemera,” and Forster says that he and
Dickens “laughed heartily at the description,
hardly a word of which is true.” Be this as it
may, when Mr. and Mrs. Dickens came to America
in 1842, Willis ran down to New York to
be present at the “Boz” ball. He wrote to his
wife at Glenmary that he had spent an afternoon
in showing Mrs. Dickens the splendors of
Broadway, and had danced with her at the ball,
where, encountering Halleck, the two poets
“slipped down about midnight to the ‘Cornucopia’
and had rum toddy and broiled oysters.”
Among Willis’s private papers is a cordial letter
from Dickens, dated at Niagara, April 30, 1842,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
regretting that he should not have time to accept
his invitation to make him a visit at Owego.</p>

<p>A <i lang="fr">rapprochement</i> now took place between
Willis and his former associate General Morris.
The “New York Mirror” of December 31, 1842,
announced that, expenditures having largely exceeded
receipts, the paper would henceforth be
discontinued, but that a new series would begin
in a few weeks. The issue of the 17th of the
same month had contained two short sketches,
“Imogen and Cymbeline” and “A Charming
Widow of Sixty,” which were afterwards joined
into one and worked up into “Poyntz’s Aunt.”
These were of no importance except as being his
first direct contributions to the “Mirror” since
the establishment of the “Corsair,” over two
years and a half before. On Saturday, April 8,
1843, the first number of the “New Mirror”
was issued under the joint editorship of Morris
and Willis. The latter had now entered upon
an active career of journalism which lasted, with
a single brief interruption, for nearly a quarter
of a century, till his death in 1867. With the
“New Mirror” he resumed the duties of an editor,
which he had laid down when he sold out the
“American Monthly” in 1831. He had been,
it is true, a nominal editor of the old “New York
Mirror” and of the “Corsair,” but virtually he
was merely a contributor and foreign correspondent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of both these papers, and had felt no real
responsibility for their conduct. In the three
periodicals which Morris and Willis now edited
successively, the “New Mirror,” the “Evening
Mirror,” and the “Home Journal,” the business
management remained in the hands of the former,
but the literary policy was largely shaped
by Willis, and almost the entire time and energies
of both partners were given to their enterprises.
The office of the new journal was at No.
4 Ann Street, and its title in full ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The New Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and
Instruction: Containing Original Papers, Tales of
Romance, Sketches of Society, Manners, and Everyday
Life; Domestic and Foreign Correspondence;
Wit and Humor; Fashion and Gossip; the Fine Arts
and Literary, Musical, and Dramatic Criticism; extracts
from New Works; Poetry, Original and Selected;
the Spirit of the Public Journals, etc., etc.,
etc.”</p>

</div>

<p>Willis could not afford to give up all the other
strings to his bow until he saw how the new venture
was going to succeed. He retained his
position as New York correspondent to the “National
Intelligencer,” and his “Daguerreotype
Sketches of New York,” published in that paper,
were regularly reprinted in the “New Mirror.”
His stories in “Graham’s” and “Godey’s” went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
on up to January, 1844, after which time he announced
that he should write in future exclusively
for his own paper. His contributions to
the “Mirror,” while editor, included tales, poems,
sketches, reminiscences, letters, book notices,
besides editorial papers of a miscellaneous sort,
such as “Jottings,” “Slipshoddities,” “Diary of
Town Trifles,” “More Particularly,” “Just You
and I,” “While We hold You by the Button,”
and what not, in which he set himself to catch
and reflect the passing humors and picturesque
surfaces of town life. He might have said of
his muse at this time, as the psalmist of his soul,
<i lang="la">Adhæsit pavimento</i>. He wrote a number of
“City Lyrics,” signed “Down Town Bard,”
celebrating beauties in white chip hats, whom he
had helped into omnibuses: Broadway odes, inviting
his sweetheart to a moonlight walk up to
Thompson’s for an ice; or mock heroic lamentations
in blank verse, that the lady in the
chemisette with black buttons, whose sixpence
he had passed up to the driver, might be doomed
to pass him forever without meeting,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Thou in a Knickerbocker Line, and I</div>
<div class="verse">Lone in the Waverley.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It might have been expected that Willis, with
his peculiarly dainty instinct, would excel in this
carving of cherry stones. But his society verses
in this kind were too hurriedly done and fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
short of that perfect workmanship and fineness
of taste which float many a trifle of Praed or
Dobson. Willis’s city poems are flimsy and
sometimes a little vulgar, and their place is mid-way
between really artistic society verse and
such metropolitan ballads as “Walking Down
Broadway” and “Tassels on the Boots,” which
Lingard used to sing. The best of them, perhaps,
is “Love in a Cottage,” a charmingly
frank expression of a preference for the artificial,
a quatrain from which has got into common
quotation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“But give me a sly flirtation</div>
<div class="verse indent1">By the light of a chandelier,</div>
<div class="verse">With music to play in the pauses,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And nobody very near.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These “City Lyrics” were not all humorous,
however. The bitter contrasts which forced
themselves upon Bryant walking “slowly through
the crowded street” appealed also to the “Down
Town Bard,” who expressed them in “The Pity
of the Park Fountain,” and more successfully
in “Unseen Spirits,” first printed in the “New
Mirror” of July 29, 1843. This little poem&mdash;suggested,
perhaps, in some mood of abstraction
when the poet was strolling listlessly up
Broadway, his spirits low and his eternal watchfulness
for effects asleep&mdash;has, for that very
reason doubtless, the sudden touch of genius, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
unconsciousness and careless felicity which seem
likely to keep it alive and to make it, possibly,
the only work of Willis destined to reach posterity.
It was a favorite with Edgar Poe, who
used to recite it at reading clubs and the like,
and who said that, in his opinion and that of
nearly all his friends, it was “the truest poem
ever written by Mr. Willis. There is about this
little poem,” he continues, “(evidently written
in haste and through impulse) a true imagination.
Its grace, dignity, and pathos are impressive,
and there is more in it of earnestness of
soul than in anything I have seen from the pen
of its author.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Willis took advantage of his new facilities to
become his own publisher, issuing successively,
as shilling extras in the “Mirror Library,” his
“Sacred Poems,” “Poems of Passion,” and
“Lady Jane and Humorous Poems;” following
these up with the first complete editions, from
the “Mirror” press, of “Letters from Under
a Bridge,” and “Pencillings by the Way.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
poems contained few notable additions to “Melanie”
and earlier volumes, except those just
mentioned as printed in the “New Mirror,” and
the lines on the death of President Harrison,
which were much admired at the time. They
were in anapestics, an unusual metre with him,
but one which he handled not without fire in
this excellent elegy. “Lady Jane” was a society
poem in some two hundred “Don Juan” stanzas
and was by no means the worst of the many
imitations of Byron’s inimitable masterpiece&mdash;if
the bull may be pardoned. The hero was
the inevitable dandy poet,&mdash;this time he was
twenty-two,&mdash;and the heroine who doted on him
with a half motherly affection was a well preserved
English countess of forty, wedded to a
decrepit but accommodating earl. The noble
pair go traveling, with the boyish poet in their
train, and coming to Rome, the latter becomes
enamored of an Italian marchioness and cuts
loose from Lady Jane, who, “having loved too
late to dream of love again,” grows old as best
she may. This is all, but the poet has caught,
as successfully as was possible for him, the alternate
irony and sentiment, the rattling digressiveness,
and the eccentric rhyming and audacious
punning of his original. There is a delicate
suggestion of Lady Blessington in the heroine;
but Willis’s English acquaintances could hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
have felt pleased at being served up by name in
the picture of a London <i lang="fr">soirée</i>, as “Savage
Landor, wanting soap and sand,” as “frisky
Bowring, London’s wisest bore,” or even as
“calm, old, lily-white Joanna Baillie.” Willis
was now in considerable request for lectures
and occasional poems. On August 17, 1841,
he delivered a poem before the Linonian Society
of Yale College, extracts from which appear
in his collected poems as “The Elms of
New Haven.” This address was not without
touches of fancy and tender reminders to the
assembled scholars of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The green tent where your harness was put on,”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the blank verse carried him along into that
smooth diffuseness which was his besetting sin,
and the poem, as a whole, did not rise above
commonplace. It compares but poorly with
Dr. Holmes’s noble “Astræa,” delivered in 1850
before the Phi Beta Kappa society at New
Haven by a poet who, though the son of another
Alma Mater, gracefully acknowledged himself
the grandson of Yale. At another time, in response
to an invitation from James T. Fields to
recite a poem in Boston, Willis wrote: “I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the time to consider whether there <em>could be</em>
such a thing as an effective <em>spoken</em> poem. I
am satisfied now, that my style depends so much
on those light shades which would be lost on
more ears than two at a time, that I should
make an utter failure.” In 1843 he lectured
on the formation of character before the Mercantile
Library Association of Baltimore, and
the audience&mdash;a large one&mdash;was disappointed
by the serious nature of the address. A “Lecture
on Fashion” given before the New York
Lyceum and published in 1844 was more characteristic,
at least in subject. He lectured also
in Boston and Albany, perhaps in other places,
but without marked success, being an indifferent
orator and not at home on the platform. “The
calling on a hen for an egg, while she stands on
the fence, would seem to me reasonable,” said
he, “in comparison with asking for my sentiments,
to be delivered on my legs.”</p>

<p>In the issue of the “New Mirror” for September
28, 1844, the editors announced that
they had been driven out of the field of weekly
journalism by the United States Post Office.
The “Mirror,” being stitched, could not go at
newspaper rates, but was taxed, at the caprice
of postmasters, from two to fifteen cents a copy.
This more than doubled the price to country
readers and killed the mail subscription. Remonstrances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
addressed to the authorities at
Washington only brought, in reply, a letter of
“sesquipedalian flummery.” Accordingly the
editors decided to change the shape of the paper
and publish it as a daily. The first number of
the “Evening Mirror” came out October 7,
1844. It was published every day in the week
but Sunday, and ran till the close of the following
year, under the joint conduct of Morris,
Willis, and Hiram Fuller. The last was a
young man, and a far-away cousin of Margaret
Fuller. He continued the paper, under the
same name, for years after his partners had left
him. It was of Fuller that Bennett said, “We
saw the editor of the ‘Evening Mirror,’ the
other day, treating his subscribers to an excursion;
he drove them all down Broadway to the
Battery in an omnibus.” Edgar Poe was engaged
upon the “Evening Mirror” as critic and
sub-editor in the autumn of 1844, and remained
upon it about six months. His relations with
Willis were of the pleasantest. The latter tried
to befriend him in various ways and lent him
the hearty support of his paper. His recollections
of his former associate were given in the
“Home Journal” for October 13, 1849, shortly
after Poe’s death, in an article bearing generous
testimony to his perfect regularity, reasonableness,
and courtesy, while engaged upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
“Mirror.” Poe’s own estimate of Willis is
given at some length in his series of papers on
“The Literati of New York.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is friendly
in tone, but quite impartial and discriminating.
Its literary criticism need not be here repeated,
but Poe’s personal impressions of Willis are
worth giving:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Willis’s career,” he writes, “has naturally
made him enemies among the envious host of dunces
whom he has outstripped in the race for fame; and
these his personal manner (a little tinctured with
reserve, <i lang="fr">brusquerie</i>, or even haughtiness) is by no
means adapted to conciliate. He has innumerable
warm friends, however, and is himself a warm friend.
He is impulsive, generous, bold, impetuous, vacillating,
irregularly energetic, apt to be hurried into
error, but incapable of deliberate wrong. He is yet
young and, without being handsome in the ordinary
sense, is a remarkably well-looking man. In height
he is perhaps five feet eleven and justly proportioned.
His figure is put in the best light by the ease and assured
grace of his carriage. His whole person and
personal demeanor bear about them the traces of
‘good society.’ His face is somewhat too full or
rather heavy in its lower proportions. Neither his
nose nor his forehead can be defended. The latter
would puzzle phrenology. His eyes are a dull bluish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
gray and small. His hair is of a rich brown, curling
naturally and luxuriantly. His mouth is well cut,
the teeth fine, the expression of the smile intellectual
and winning. He converses little, <em>well</em> rather than
fluently, and in a subdued tone.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was after Morris and Willis had dissolved
their connection with the “Evening Mirror”
that that journal published the article, by
Thomas Dunn English, reflecting severely on
Poe’s character, for which he sued Fuller and
recovered $225 damages. His “Raven” was
written while he was on the paper, and first published
anonymously in the “American Review.”
Willis reprinted it in the “Mirror” over Poe’s
name, with a send-off, in which he said, “We
regard it as the most effective single example of
fugitive poetry ever published in this country.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The year 1844-45 was a sad one for Willis.
In the preface to “Poems of Passion,” 1843, he
had written, “We are accused daily of writing
nothing that is not frivolous. These poems are
from the undercurrent of our frivolity; and
they run as deep, we are inclined to think, as a
man ever sees into his heart till it is rent open
with a calamity&mdash;and calamity as yet, we never
knew.” But in March, 1844, he lost that admirable
mother whose love had been to him both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
a stay and an inspiration. His youngest sister,
Ellen, had died the month before. And a year
later, March 25, 1845, at the Astor House,
his wife died in childbirth. “An angel without
fault or foible” is the comment which the
broken-hearted husband wrote against the record
of her death in his note-book. The child,
a girl, for whom he had chosen the name
of Blanche, was born dead. The labor of editing
a daily paper had proved unexpectedly burdensome
and, added to the grief of his bereavement,
left him greatly exhausted and under the
need of breaking away from work for a time.
In the early summer of 1845 he sailed on the
Britannic for Liverpool, taking with him his
little daughter Imogen, and the faithful colored
woman, Harriet Jacobs, who had been the child’s
nurse during Mrs. Willis’s lifetime. Before
starting for England he had gathered up his
recent story contributions to the magazines and
published them, together with “Inklings of Adventure,”
and “Romance of Travel,” in a single
large volume, “Dashes at Life with a Free Pencil.”
This was divided into three parts: “High
Life in Europe and American Life,” “Inklings
of Adventure,” and “Loiterings of Travel.”
A fourth part, “Ephemera,” was added in
1854. The tales which he had written since
1840, and which now appeared for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
in book form, exhibited more range and variety
of subject than his two previous collections, but
a decided falling off in literary quality. Those
who had seen promise in some of the earlier
stories&mdash;such as “Edith Linsey,” “The Picker
and Piler,” and “The Lunatic’s Skate”&mdash;of a
capacity for stronger and graver work were disappointed
by these later “Dashes.” None of
them was without clever strokes, but they were,
as a whole, very light. The “High Life”
stories were mostly repetitions of Willis’s favorite
plot. Sometimes the hero is a spoiled child
of genius, as in “Countess Nyschriem and the
Handsome Artist,” and “Leaves from the Heart
Book of Ernest Clay.” Sometimes, as in “The
Revenge of the Signor Basil,” he is a designing
villain. Again, as in “Love and Diplomacy,”
he turns out to be a very great person in disguise,
who flings off his cloak in the <i lang="fr">dénouement</i>
and confounds his adversaries. In “Getting
to Windward,” he is a French adventurer,
for whom three English peeresses contend&mdash;like
the Goddesses on Ida. In “Flirtation and Fox
Chasing,” he is a Kentucky lady-killer, sojourning
at an English country house. In “Lady
Rachel,” he is nobody in particular. But in
each and all of these protean shapes, he is
equally fascinating and invincible. In “Beware
of Dogs and Waltzing,” the author entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
confessional with even less precaution than
usual. It is quite plain to one reading between
the lines, that the hero, Mr. Lindsay Maud,
with his <i lang="fr">retroussé</i> nose, sanguineous tint, curly
hair, and dimpled chin, is no other than Willis
himself; that the Surrey manor where the scene
is laid is Shirley Park; that its hospitable occupants,
the Becktons, are in truth the Skinner
family; that Mabel Brown, the heroine, is identical
with Miss Mary Stace; and, lastly, that
Miss Blakeney, the dazzling but heartless heiress,
whose hand Mr. Maud’s hostess kindly destines
for her young <i lang="fr">protégé</i>, but whom, yielding
to his better angel, he flings overboard in
favor of the gentler and sweeter Mabel, is a
certain belle of fortune, who figures in Willis’s
private correspondence as “trotted out” by
Mrs. Skinner for his inspection with a view to
his making a rich marriage.</p>

<p>In “A Revelation of a Previous Life” and
“The Phantom Head upon the Table,” the supernatural
is introduced, but not with success.
Willis had not the weird, haunting imagination
of Hawthorne or Poe. He does not prepare the
reader’s belief by creating the atmosphere of mystery
required for illusion. In the midst of the
fashionable, real life where they are set, his supernatural
incidents lose their effect, and have no
<i lang="fr">vraisemblance</i>. Nor was he more at home in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
broad comedy. His humor&mdash;and he had humor&mdash;was
delicate rather than robust; was made out
of irony, pleasantry, and gay spirits, and depended
more upon situation than character. If
the situation was droll, the humor was good;
otherwise not. “Miss Jones’s Son,” “The Spirit
Love of Ione S&mdash;&mdash;,” “Nora Mehidy,” “Meena
Dimity,” and “Born to love Pigs and Chickens”
were all <i lang="fr">manqué</i>. The best of the humorous tales
is “The Female Ward,” which tells of the embarrassments
of a rather fast young gentleman in
Boston, who receives an unexpected consignment,
in the shape of a raw heiress, from a Southern
plantation; her confiding parents intrusting her
to his guardianship, with a request that he place
her at school in some high-toned seminary. His
difficulties in trying to perform this commission,
ending with his lodging her temporarily in a private
lunatic asylum, are very happily imagined.
“The Female Ward” would lend itself nicely to
the dramatizer, and make up into a most amusing
little farce. “Those Ungrateful Blidginses”
was funny, but wicked. It was Willis’s
way of avenging himself upon two maiden ladies
with whom he had fallen in, and subsequently
fallen out, during his travels in Italy, and who,
on returning to America, had circulated reports
not to his credit. He had another hit at them
in “Ernest Clay,” as “two abominable old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
maids by the name of Buggins or Blidgins, representing
the <i lang="la">scan. mag.</i> of Florence.” The
story caused a good deal of scandal. The victims
(whose names were thinly disguised) were high
in Knickerbocker social circles, and the doors
of many of the best houses in Albany and New
York were closed forever against Willis, as a
consequence of this indiscretion. There was
even some rumor in the Albany newspapers to
the effect that he had been challenged by a friend
of the injured ladies, and had declined the challenge,
but this he denied. “Kate Crediford”
is a clever specimen of anti-climax. The writer
sees an old love at the theatre and, fancying
that she looks unhappy, his flame revives, and
he goes home and writes her an impassioned declaration.
His letter is answered by the lady’s
husband, who informs him of her recent marriage,
and explains her pensiveness by the fact
that she had eaten too heartily of unripe fruit
before going to the play. In “The Poet and
the Mandarin” and “The Inlet of Peach Blossoms,”
the descriptions are richly fanciful. But
the most truly imaginative of all these tales is
“The Ghost Ball at Congress Hall.” The
theme is one that would have delighted Hawthorne,
and though he might have treated it
more meaningly, he could not have improved
upon its wild, half-eerie gayety, with its undercurrent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of regret&mdash;the old Horatian regret for
the shortness of life and vanished youth. A superannuated
beau, lingering in the empty colonnade
of Congress Hall after the close of the
Saratoga season, sees a spectral procession of
coaches drive up to the door and deposit, one
after another, their loads of ladies with escorts
and baggage. Later in the evening, peering in
through the ball-room windows, his brain reels
as he beholds the well-remembered belles and
dandies&mdash;apparently grown no older&mdash;of the
golden age of the springs, the days of “the
Albany regency.” They dance to the same old
waltz music, played by the same old negro fiddlers,
by the light of spermaceti tapers that floods
the dusty evergreens “with a weird mysteriousness,
an atmosphere of magic, even in the burning
of the candles,” and drink champagne of “the
exploded color, rosy wine suited to the bright
days when all things were tinted rose.”</p>

<p>It is needless to say that there is an abundance
of pretty and clever things scattered
through these tales of Willis. “Flirtation”&mdash;as
an instance of his epigrams&mdash;“is a circulating
library in which we seldom ask twice for the
same volume.” “His politeness,” he says of one
of his characters, “had superseded his character
altogether.” He tells of “a person of excellent
family, after the fashion of a hill of potatoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the best part of it under ground;” and of
the Frenchman who could trace his lineage back
to “the man who spoke French in the confusion
of Babel.” “Mr. Potts’s income was a net answer
to his morning prayer: it provided his
daily bread.” “Wigwam <i lang="la">vs.</i> Almacks,” which
follows out the suggestions of a true story told
in “À l’Abri,” is not very satisfactory as a fiction,
but is worth noticing for the lovely description,
with which it opens, of a wayside spring in
the valley of the Chemung.</p>

1845-1852.<br />
<span class="smaller">THIRD VISIT TO ENGLAND&mdash;THE HOME
JOURNAL.</span></h2>

<p>On his arrival in London, Willis was attacked
with a brain fever, which confined him to his
bed for a fortnight. As soon as he could get
about he brought his little daughter to see Lady
Blessington, and then took her and her nurse to
Steventon Vicarage, near Abingdon, in Berkshire,
to stay with her aunt, the wife of Rev.
William Vincent, formerly of Bolney Priory.
He took lodgings for himself in the village near
by, and, after a short trip to Bath, returned to
London and spent some time in visiting, dining
out, sight-seeing, and making new acquaintances.
He met a Mr. Stiles of Georgia, an old schoolmate,
who was passing through England on his
way to Vienna, where he had lately been appointed
<i lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</i>, and who gave him a
complimentary appointment as <i lang="fr">attaché</i> to his legation,
an addition to his passport of the kind
that had proved so serviceable in the days of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
“Pencillings.” This determined him to shape
his course for the capital of Austria, taking in
Germany, which was new to him, on the way.
Leaving his daughter at Steventon, he crossed
the Channel, went up the Rhine, and joined his
brother Richard, who was studying music at
Leipsic. Here he passed a month, and then, accompanied
by his brother, went on to Dresden.
There the two parted, and Willis traveled alone
to Berlin, where he was again seriously ill, and
was kindly ministered to by his old friend and
associate on the “New York Mirror,” T. S. Fay,
at that time secretary of legation at Berlin.
Mr. Henry Wheaton, the American minister, attached
Willis also to the Prussian mission.
But of these appointments and the opportunities
they promised he was unable to avail himself.
Continued ill health forced him to abandon his
journey to Vienna, and to make his way back to
England, whence he sailed for home in the
spring of 1846. He had meant to leave Imogen
with her mother’s family for a time, to be
put to school in England. But his heart failed
him at the last, and he brought her back with
him to America, sending her, still in charge of
her nurse, to live with his sister, Mrs. Louis
Dwight, in Boston. He himself took rooms in
New York until other arrangements could be
made. His child’s nurse, Harriet Jacobs, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
was in his employ from 1842 to 1861, was a
remarkable woman, whose career, if fully told,
would form an interesting chapter in the history
of American slavery. She was an escaped slave
from a plantation near Edenton, North Carolina.
She had run away from her master when
a young woman, and taken refuge with a family
of free negroes, her kinsfolk. They kept her hidden
for five years in a cubby under the roof, during
which time she supported herself by fine
needlework which her friends sold for her in
town. At last she escaped to the North, and was
engaged by Willis as a house servant when he
went to Glenmary. Her attachment to the interests
of the family during the whole period of
her service was a beautiful instance of the fidelity
and affection which sometimes, but not often,
distinguish the relation of master and servant
even in this land of change. Mrs. Jacobs’s
former owners, having got wind in some way of
her whereabouts, came North in quest of her, and
spared no pains to reclaim the runaway. Several
times she had to leave the Willises and go
into hiding at Boston and elsewhere. At last,
tired of these alarms, Willis sacrificed whatever
scruples he might have had against such a step,
and bought her freedom out and out. When
the civil war began she went to Washington, and
employed her practical abilities, which were of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
a high order, in the post of matron to a soldiers’
hospital. In that city she is still living, at an
advanced age.</p>

<p>Though ill nearly all the time of this his third
trip abroad, Willis managed to write a number
of “Invalid Letters” to the “Evening Mirror,”
which were collected in “Famous Persons and
Places” and in “Rural Letters.” They were
scarcely worth preserving. England was now a
twice-told tale, and in Germany, which was a
pasture new, he was too tired and sick and borne
down by his recent bereavement to take much
interest in anything. His articles about the
great fair at Leipsic&mdash;“What I saw at the
Fair,” in “Godey’s” for October, 1847; and
“On Dress,” in “The Opal” for 1848, and
“Godey’s” for June, 1849&mdash;were the most considerable
literary results of the journey. He
also superintended the publication of an English
edition of “Dashes at Life,” in three volumes,
and came home under engagement to write for
the London “Morning Chronicle.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the editorial corps of the “Evening
Mirror” had tapered down to Hiram Fuller.
Willis had practically retired from any
active share in its management when he left the
country in the spring of 1845. He was still
abroad when Morris withdrew from it and
started a new paper, the “National Press,” toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the close of the same year. Willis joined
him in this enterprise as soon as he got back
from England. During the spring and summer
of 1846 he was often in Washington, as correspondent
of the “National Press” and the
“Morning Chronicle,” and while there he met
Miss Cornelia Grinnell, the niece and adopted
daughter of the Hon. Joseph Grinnell, who was
then representative in Congress from New Bedford,
Massachusetts. To this lady he was married
on October 1, 1846, the eleventh anniversary
of his first marriage. She was his junior
by nearly twenty years, but she united to her
graces of person and character a penetrating
mind and an uncommon energy and firmness of
will, which made her an invaluable helpmate
through the years of trial that were in store for
both. On the 21st of November following, the
name of the “National Press” was changed to
the “Home Journal,” under which title the paper
has ever since been published. This was Morris’s
and Willis’s final and most prosperous experiment
in journalism. They both remained
connected with it till death: in Willis’s case a
service of twenty-one years, during which his literary
toil was devoted almost exclusively to building
up the paper. “For the cultivation of the
memorable, the progressive, and the beautiful,”
ran the legend upon its title-page, followed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
sentence from Goethe, which still stands as the
motto of the paper, and would have served well
enough as the motto of Willis’s own career:
“We should do our utmost to encourage the
beautiful, for the useful encourages itself.” It
was not a very solid type of literature which was
fostered by the “Home Journal,” but it made
for itself a peculiar constituency, and a place in
the world of letters which it still successfully occupies,
under the editorship of Morris Phillips,
General Morris’s adopted son, who has carried
out the traditions of the paper as established by
his predecessors. It was and is the organ of
“japonicadom,” the journal of society and gazette
of fashionable news and fashionable literature,
addressing itself with assiduous gallantry
to “the ladies.”</p>

<p>Willis set himself more especially in both the
“New Mirror” and the “Home Journal” to
portray the town. He became a sort of Knickerbocker
Spectator, and his “Ephemera,” published
in 1854, is a running record of the notabilities
of New York for a dozen years. He chronicled
the operas and theatres: Ole Bull, Jenny
Lind, and Macready; the shops, the omnibuses,
the endless procession of Broadway, the museum,
the art galleries, the Tombs, the Alhambra, the
Five Points, the Croton water, the cafés, the
hotels, the balls and receptions, the changes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
equipages, customs, dress. He grew to be a
recognized <i lang="la">arbiter elegantiarum</i>, and his correspondence
columns were crowded with appeals
on knotty points of etiquette or costume. His
decisions of these social problems were always
marked by good sense and good taste. There
are many nice bits in “Ephemera,” and some
little wholes,&mdash;like the letter from Saratoga,
“To the Julia of Some Years Ago,”&mdash;which
deserve to be rescued from the oblivion of a
book of scraps and trifles. He was a skillful
paragrapher; he had unfailing tact and knew
when to stop. Above all, he was eminently human;
his gregariousness and his cheerful philosophy
cast a gleam of their own on this looking-glass
of urban life. He imported a rural
air into the city; watched how April greened
the grass in the public squares, and June spread
the leaves in Trinity Churchyard; stopped to
pick “a clovertop or an aggravating dandelion
’twixt post office and city hall;” and discovered
even in the stream that washed the curbstone,
“a clear brook&mdash;a brook with a song, tripping
as musically (when the carts are not going by)
as the beloved brook” in Glenmary. Pan, we
know, has been found in Wall Street; and Willis
contrived to find something like a nymph in
the waste of the Park fountain. When his
work kept him at the desk all through the hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
summer, he borrowed a breeze from “the outermost
bastion of Castle Garden,” and made the
Jersey ferryboat his “substitute for a private
yacht.”</p>

<p>When he came to New York to live, in 1842,
and during his continued residence there for
more than ten years from that date, Manhattan
was by no means the metropolis that it is to-day,
though it had begun to assume already that
cosmopolitan and intensely commercial character
which distinguishes it from all other American
cities. It had a considerable and swiftly
growing foreign population, and its society was
marked by a liveliness and extravagance which
contrasted with the plainer and more earnest
tone prevailing in Boston, and with the somewhat
provincial cast of Philadelphia life. The
Battery was still the fashionable promenade,
Canal Street was “up town,” Hoboken, a rural
suburb, Pine, Ann, and William Streets, and
the Bowling Green were genteel residence quarters.
The old Park Theatre was&mdash;after the
burning of the National&mdash;the only respectable
playhouse, until Niblo’s was opened in what was
then the outskirt of the town. New York prided
itself, moreover, on being a literary centre. The
term “Knickerbocker School,” which has been
invented to describe a group of metropolitan
writers who owed their inspiration, in some sort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to Washington Irving, is of uncertain application;
and there was no such cohesion among the
members of the group as to warrant the name
of a school. But if the term be extended to
cover all the authors whose birth or long residence
identified them with New York city, it
may include Bryant and Halleck, who were the
most prominent literary figures when Willis
went there to live, though both of them, like
him, were of New England birth and breeding.
Bryant had been since 1826 editor of the
“Evening Post” and Halleck, who had almost
ceased to write and was devoting himself exclusively
to his duties as secretary to Mr. John
Jacob Astor, left the city in 1849, and retired
to his old home in Guilford, Connecticut. With
both of these Willis was more or less intimate,
meeting them frequently at dinners and in general
society. Irving himself, the starting-point
of the Knickerbocker writers, was out of the
country when Willis settled in New York, having
gone as minister to Spain in 1842. He came
back in 1846 and took up his residence at Sunnyside.
Cooper was living at Cooperstown, where
Willis made him a flying visit and renewed the
acquaintance so pleasantly begun at Paris in
1832. This was in the summer of 1848, which
Willis spent at Sharon Springs, recovering from
an attack of rheumatism. Theodore Fay too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
was abroad, filling diplomatic posts in Germany
and Switzerland. Years after, on his return to
America, he visited Willis at Idlewild, and the
latter found him greatly aged and saddened
since the days when he wrote mild town satires
and humorous sketches for the “New York
Mirror.” Eastburn, Sands, and Drake were
all dead, and Paulding had signalized the close
of his literary career by publishing a collection
of his works in numerous volumes. He too had
been a contributor to the old “Mirror,” and so
had another of the Knickerbockers, Charles
Fenno Hoffman, who had once edited the paper
for a month, before Willis had any connection
with it. Hoffman, who died just the other day,
is known to this generation almost solely by his
still popular song, “Sparkling and Bright,” and
his hardly less popular “Monterey.” The former
is sung by collegians and the latter declaimed
by school-boys. He was the first editor of the
“Knickerbocker Magazine.” His “Winter in
the West” and his novel, “Greyslaer,” founded
on the famous Beauchamp tragedy in North Carolina,
had wide currency in their time, and his
amusing story, “The Man in the Reservoir,”
may still be read with enjoyment. He was a
man of many friends, greatly beloved for his
frank and cordial nature. By 1846 he had already
begun to show symptoms of the mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
disease which issued in his chronic insanity.
He kept on writing up to 1850, when it was
found necessary to send him to an asylum, in
which confinement he lived for over thirty years.
Hoffman once said of Willis’s eyes that they
“always seemed to have nothing but cold speculation
in them,&mdash;to be two holes, looking out
through a stone wall.” Then there were Verplanck,
the editor of Shakespeare, and Duyckinck
the compiler of the “Cyclopædia of American
Literature,” and many forgotten worthies, whose
names may be read in such limbos of departed
fame as Poe’s “Literati of New York.” Many
of these literati used to meet each other informally
at the weekly receptions given by Miss
Anne Lynch (now Mrs. Botta) the poetess, and
author of the “Handbook of Universal Literature,”
whose hospitable parlors have been for
forty years a rallying place for interesting and
distinguished people. With this lady Mr. and
Mrs. Willis formed a close and lasting friendship.
Willis used to go often to Horace Greeley’s,
where he got interested for a time in
spirit rappings, and wrote some papers on the
subject in the “Home Journal.” Greeley once
urged him in a letter (November 18, 1854) to
publish a volume of selections from his lifelong
writings. “I want such a one,” he wrote, “for
my boy, so that, should I live to see him sixteen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
I may try ‘Unwritten Music’ on him and see
if it impresses him as it did me at about that
age, when it appeared.”</p>

<p>During the first winter and spring after their
marriage, Willis and his wife lived in lodgings.
In the autumn of 1847 they went to housekeeping
at No. 19 Ludlow Place, where their
eldest son, Grinnell, was born, April 28, 1848.
In the fall of that year they bought the house
No. 198 Fourth Street, where they remained
till the fall of 1852. A daughter, Lilian, was
born April 27, 1850.</p>

<p>For ten years Willis’s tall and elegantly
dressed figure was a familiar sight on Broadway,
and was often pointed out to strangers at public
assemblages, or in private society, where his
agreeable manners made him a general favorite.
He was never what is called a brilliant
conversationalist, but he was an easy talker and
quick at an impromptu, many of his “good
things” in which kind are remembered and
quoted by his contemporaries. Thus, on one
occasion, at a dinner party in Washington, a
young lady who sat between Willis and a gentleman
named Campbell was rather too partial
in her attention to the former. Her mother
sitting opposite, and considering Mr. Campbell
a desirable <i lang="la">parti</i>, slipped her a note across the
table, “Pay more attention to your other neighbor.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
This being shown to Willis, he wrote on
the back of it,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Dear Mamma don’t essay my flirtation to trammel:</div>
<div class="verse">I but strain at a Nat while you swallow a Campbell.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When in Germany, he went with some gentlemen
to visit a deaf and dumb asylum which had
an inscription over the gate, <i lang="de">Stiftung</i>, etc.
“Stifftongue,” said Willis, looking up; “very
appropriate.”</p>

<p>Like most men who overwork their pens, he
was impatient of private correspondence. When
in England, he excused his brevity on the plea
that he was paid a guinea a page for everything
he wrote, and could not afford to waste manuscript.
“Private Letters,” he declared in a
note to Edgar Poe, “are the ‘last ounce that
breaks the camel’s back’ of a literary man.” And
he once answered a friend who proposed a correspondence,
that to ask him to write a letter
after his day’s work was like asking a penny
postman to take a walk in the evening for the
pleasure of it. His letters to his family and
friends have seldom any literary quality, though
they contain, now and then, characteristically
quaint or playful touches. “Kiss mother on
her sad expression” is a message in one of
them; and in another he refers to one of his
little nieces as the most charming “copy of
Willis” extant. Having been invited to sit on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the stage, at the Commencement of Rutgers
Female College, as “the author of ‘Absalom’
and ‘Hagar,’” he wrote, “I shall try to have
the air of the Old Testament, but have my
doubts as to success.”</p>

<p>The easy <i lang="fr">dégagé</i> air of his writing was, as is
usually the case with seemingly ready writers,
the result of laborious care. It appears from
the testimony of Poe, Parton, Phillips, and others
who were his associates on the “Mirror” or
“Home Journal” and knew his habits of composition,
that his manuscript was full of erasures
and interlineations. He blotted, on an average,
one line out of every three, but his copy was so
neatly and legibly prepared that the compositors
preferred it to “reprint,” even his erasures having
“a certain wavy elegance.” He was likewise
very particular about having his articles
printed just as he wrote them. “My copy <em>must</em>
be followed,” he wrote to an offending foreman.
“If I insert a comma in the middle of a word,
do you place it there and ask no questions.”
Once a slight alteration by Morris in the wording
of a paragraph in Willis’s manuscript came
near causing a quarrel between the two old
friends, “probably the only misunderstanding
or disagreement,” says Mr. Phillips, “which occurred
during the whole of their literary life
and business association.” “I would not stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
one week a partner with a man who ventured to
alter a word of my copy and send it to press
without my knowledge,” wrote Willis in his
angry note to Morris on this occasion. Mr. Phillips
adds that “General Morris proved his love
for Mr. Willis by not replying to this letter, but
simply wrote on the back of it, ‘I would have
received this from no other man living.’” From
similar testimony it appears that Willis took no
share in the business management of the paper,
never examined the books, nor asked any questions
as to the circulation. He felt or affected
a horror of figures, and confided the matter of
receipts and expenditures entirely to General
Morris, between whom and himself, during the
entire period of their partnership, no statement
of account was ever rendered. In money matters
Willis was liberal,&mdash;not to say reckless,&mdash;and
his hospitality knew no limit. Nor was it
only his roof and his table that were at his
friends’ service; his literary latch-string was always
out to every new-comer in the field of letters.
It was an honorable trait in his character,
and should never be forgotten in casting his account,
that, whatever may have been his foibles,
the jealousy which is the besetting sin of authors
and artists was not among them. He was perpetually
on the lookout for young writers of
promise, and was the first to praise them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
to give circulation to their good things by copying
them into his columns. He was the introducer
and literary sponsor of many reputations
now fallen silent, and of some which have survived.
Among the last were Mr. T. B. Aldrich&mdash;who
succeeded James Parton as assistant editor
of the “Home Journal”&mdash;and Bayard Taylor.
The latter was greatly in Willis’s debt. His
desire for travel was first awakened by reading
the “Pencillings by the Way” when he was a
lad of sixteen. And afterwards when he came
to New York to seek the means for foreign
travel he applied at once to the author whose
brilliant pictures of European life had roused
his young enthusiasm. Willis befriended him
in every way; gave him letters to wealthy gentlemen
in New York, and bestirred himself to
interest people in his adventure and raise the
sum necessary to start him on his journey. On
his departure he gave him a letter to his brother
Richard, in Frankfort, with whom the young
<i lang="de">handwerksbursch</i> tarried for a time, while he was
picking up the German language. His “Views
Afoot”&mdash;the fruits of this venture&mdash;were dedicated
to Willis, who contributed the preface.
This patronage was unkindly referred to in Duganne’s
“Parnassus in Pillory,” a little Dunciad
of the old downright “English Bards and Scotch
Reviewers” variety, which made some noise in
New York in the year 1851:&mdash;</p>

<p>Another young poet whose career Willis
watched with interest was J. R. Lowell. There
was a friendly correspondence between the two
in 1843-44, the younger writer thanking the
older for his encouragement, sending him his
new volume of verse, and promising to contribute
to the “Mirror,” but remonstrating with
him upon his declared intention&mdash;in a very appreciative
review of Lowell’s poems in the “Mirror”&mdash;to
omit the <em>James</em> from his “musical
surname” and call him simply Russell Lowell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Suppose I, dropping the ‘N.,’ should call you by
that mysterious middle letter&mdash;whose signification,
without reference to the Parish Register (or perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Griswold’s equally entertaining bead-roll) no man can
fathom&mdash;and call you ‘P. Willis.’ Under such
painful circumstances you could imagine how I feel,
when you amputate one sound limb of my name.</p>

<p>“However, it is too cold to say any more about it.
What I have left unsaid shall be frozen up in me
like the tune in Munchausen’s bugle, and thaw out
eloquently and startlingly when I meet you in the
warmer atmosphere of New York&mdash;as I shall before
long.”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In point of fact&mdash;if the item is not below
the dignity of biography&mdash;this threat of Lowell’s
to mind Willis’s P’s for him was without
terror for the latter, who favored his middle
initial at the expense of his scriptural and baptismal
<i lang="la">prænomen</i>, and used to figure on the title-pages
of his later books as N. Parker Willis.
He disliked to be called Nathaniel; respecting
which prejudice, his wife and brothers and sisters,
as well as his intimate friends, were accustomed
to address him simply as Willis. “Truly
one’s sponsors,” said he, “have much to answer
for.” In Lowell’s smart pasquinade, “A Fable
for Critics,” published in 1848, which contains
not only headlong fun, but good poetry and just
criticism, there is a passage on Willis, from
which I venture to quote a few lines,&mdash;in spite
of its familiarity to many readers,&mdash;because its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
spirit is kindly and it is one of the best estimates
of Willis ever written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There’s Willis so <em>natty</em> and jaunty and gay,</div>
<div class="verse">Who says his best things in so foppish a way,</div>

<div class="verse">That one hardly knows whether to thank him for saying ’em.…</div>

<div class="verse">And is forced to forgive where he might have admired.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet whenever it slips away free and unlaced</div>
<div class="verse">It runs like a stream with a musical waste,</div>
<div class="verse">And gurgles along with the liquidest sweep.</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis not deep as a river, but who’d have it deep?…</div>

<div class="verse">More truly delicious than his À l’Abri,</div>

<div class="verse">Like ripple-shades netting the bed of a brook;</div>
<div class="verse">With June coming softly your shoulder to look over,</div>
<div class="verse">Breezes waiting to turn every leaf of your book over,</div>
<div class="verse">And Nature to criticise still as you read&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The page that bears that is a rare one indeed.…</div>
<div class="verse">His nature’s a glass of champagne with the foam on ’t,</div>
<div class="verse">As tender as Fletcher, as witty as Beaumont;</div>
<div class="verse">So his best things are done in the flush of the moment:</div>
<div class="verse">If he wait, all is spoiled: he may stir it and shake it,</div>
<div class="verse">But, the fixed air once gone, he can never remake it.…</div>
<div class="verse">He’d have been just the fellow to sup at the Mermaid,</div>
<div class="verse">Cracking jokes at rare Ben, with an eye to the bar-maid,</div>
<div class="verse">His wit running up as canary ran down,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">The topmost bright bubble on the wave of The Town.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>One proof of popularity is parody. Until a
statesman’s face is so familiar to the public that
its caricature in the comic papers needs no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
label, and until an author’s style is so easily
recognized that a travesty of it hits the sense
of the reader, neither statesman nor author may
consider himself as really popular. “Excelsior,”
and “The Raven,” and “Abou ben Adhem”
are by no means the best poems in the
English tongue, but their currency is attested
and doubtless kept up by the innumerable burlesque
imitations of them that swarm the press.
Willis had a share of these left-hand honors:
his epistolary style in particular was often caricatured
in the newspapers. In “Godey’s Lady’s
Book” for December, 1849, he was selected together
with Poe, Morris, Whittier, and John
Neal for humorous imitation.</p>

<p>Willis was forty when the “Home Journal”
was begun&mdash;an age at which writers who have
thought and studied deeply are often no more
than ripe, and have their most productive years
before them. But his best work was already
done. After 1846 he wrote hardly any more
stories or poems&mdash;none at all of any value.
His pen was devoted more and more steadily to
editorial duties, to ephemeræ and paragraphs
and fragments of all kinds, and his well-wishers
lamented that wit and fancy which, if properly
directed, might have produced something that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
would live and delight future generations, were
wasted in dissertations upon the cut of a beard
or the fashion of a coat. To all remonstrances of
his friends over his literary trifling and their
exhortations to write for posterity, his invariable
answer, in and out of print, was that the public
liked trifles, and that posterity would not pay his
bills&mdash;that he must go on “buttering curiosity
with the ooze of his brains.” That this answer
satisfied himself, or that he was without those
aspirations after a more enduring fame which
are natural to all, cannot be believed. It is
probable that he sadly acknowledged in his inner
consciousness that the best part of his career
was over. His talent, as has been said
before, was the result of, or was closely dependent
upon, his physical temperament. When
health began to decay, and youth was over, and
his animal spirits had effervesced, life commenced
to have a flat taste. The bloom was off.
His writing, too, as we have seen, was always
closely related to his personal experiences; and
as these grew tamer, he had less and less to
report, and his writing grew tame in proportion.
With some, mere study and contemplation supply,
to a degree, the ravages which time makes
upon the freshness of young impressions. But
it had been Willis’s misfortune in youth that a
premature success had deprived him of the discipline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of early rebuffs, and had made a painful
self-culture needless. He never drew much
inspiration from books, and in later life he read
very little. He said that he could not afford
to read, partly for want of time, partly from a
notion that much reading would be fatal to
originality. Neither was it his privilege to command,
at this or at any time, the stimulating
and bracing association with men of high serious
intellects and strenuous aims, such as he
might, perhaps, have had if he had remained in
Boston. The occasional hasty meetings with
men of brains and literary tastes in general society
did not at all take the place of that intimate
communion with a circle of gifted spirits
which has been so stimulating to others. Moreover
it should be borne in mind, as accounting
largely for the mediocrity of his later work,
that for the last fifteen years of his life Willis
was a chronic invalid. Indeed, he was never
really a well man after his illness of 1845.</p>

<p>Next to Cooper, Willis was the best abused
man of letters in America. It is easy to understand
how the former, who was pugnacious and
struck hard, should have been always in hot
water. But why a man of Willis’s urbanity
should have been a target for the newspaper
critics is more difficult of explanation. “Colonel”
William L. Stone of the “Commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Advertiser,” and “Colonel” James Watson
Webb of the “Courier and Enquirer,” distinguished
themselves especially by their stern condemnation
of Willis’s literary affectations, and
of what they were pleased to consider the weaknesses
of his private character and life. It is
suggestive, by the way, of the militant disposition
of the New York press at that time, that so
many editors were generals and colonels&mdash;or
at least were breveted such by public consent,
and graced with titular embellishments of a
warlike character. Henry J. Raymond, who
joined the “Courier and Enquirer” in 1842,
proved his zealous adhesion to the traditions of
the paper by an onslaught upon Willis, in which
he asserted that the latter had snobbishly represented
himself as received in the best circles
abroad, “when in truth ’twas no such matter.”
Willis replied to this in an editorial which Poe
mentions as a clever specimen of skill at fence.
An effort was afterwards made by friends of both
to bring them together, at a time when Willis
was living at Idlewild and Raymond was visiting
in the neighborhood. The plan miscarried
for some reason or other, though Willis, who
seldom cherished a resentment, was quite ready
for a reconciliation.</p>

<p>In 1850 Willis became unpleasantly involved
in the famous divorce suit between Edwin Forrest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and his wife. He had known Forrest as
early as 1836, admired his acting, and praised it
constantly in the “Mirror” and “Home Journal,”
preferring it to the more studied performances
of his English rival, Macready. He had
seen little of Forrest for a number of years; but
after his return to New York, in 1846, the
two families grew quite intimate, exchanging
visits and dinners. Mrs. Willis and Mrs. Forrest
especially became fast friends, and on one
occasion, when the former was seriously ill, she
sent for Mrs. Forrest to come and stay with her.
Mrs. Forrest was the daughter of Sinclair, the
great English singer. She was a lady of refinement,
beauty, and social accomplishments.
Her sister Mrs. Voorhies, who lived with her
for a time, had inherited her father’s musical
talents, and Mrs. Forrest soon got about her a
pleasant circle of friends, which included many
persons of literary and artistic tastes, editors,
authors, professors, clergymen, and their wives.
The Bryants, the Godwins, Dr. Dewey, Henry
Wikoff, and Samuel Raymond, the actor, were
among the frequenters of the house. When
Richard Willis returned from his musical studies
in Germany in 1848, his brother introduced
him there, and he found so much enthusiasm for
his art, that he called repeatedly, to practice his
compositions with Mrs. Voorhies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>Edwin Forrest was a tragedian of great natural
force and genius, endowed with a wonderful
voice and a magnificent physique. But he
was a man of passionate and overbearing temper;
his education was defective, his language
and manners sometimes offensively coarse, and
he had little relish for intellectual society. He
does not appear, however, to have felt any objection
to his wife’s hospitalities, or to have suspected
any impropriety in her receiving her
friends, during his frequent absences from home
on professional engagements, until long after
other causes of estrangement had arisen between
them. At Cincinnati, in the spring of 1848, he
thought that he had discovered evidence of a
guilty intimacy between Mrs. Forrest and an actor
named Jamieson; and although she solemnly
protested her innocence and her husband agreed
to accept her oath, his jealousy smouldered and
occasionally broke out in scenes of violence. At
length, in April, 1849, they agreed to separate.
Mrs. Forrest made her home for a time with
Mr. and Mrs. Parke Godwin, and Forrest took
up his residence in Philadelphia, where in February,
1850, he made an application for divorce
to the Pennsylvania legislature, based upon affidavits,
charging his wife with adultery. This
application was ultimately denied, but meanwhile
the lady’s friends in New York had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the matter up. She had the sympathy and
moral support of such men as William C. Bryant
and his son-in-law, Mr. Parke Godwin, and
Dr. Orville Dewey, the eminent Unitarian divine.
Up to this time Forrest had not implicated
Willis in his charges, but hearing that he
was among those who were taking sides with
Mrs. Forrest, he had stopped him in the street
one day in January, 1850, and warned him
against intermeddling between him and his wife,
denouncing her unfaithfulness in the strongest
terms. Willis replied that he did not believe
a word of the slanders against her. The next
day Mrs. Willis received an anonymous letter,
accusing her husband of criminal relations with
Mrs. Forrest. On March 28th the “Herald”
published extracts from the evidence on which
Forrest had based his application to the Pennsylvania
legislature, which compromised, among
others, Mr. Richard Willis. This drew from
his brother a letter of explanation, printed in the
“Herald” of the following day.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was not my intention,” wrote Willis, “to say
a word in this letter upon the merits of the case to
which this evidence belongs. To rescue the good
name of an absent brother, who, in moral conduct is
irreproachably correct, was my only object. A court
of justice will soon sift the testimony, and better inform
the public as to its credibility on other points.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
But the mention of my wife’s name, as a friend and
visitor of Mrs. Forrest, makes it incumbent on me to
add that the description of Mrs. Forrest’s manners
and style of hospitality which is given in that evidence
is totally at variance with all we have ever
seen and known of that dignified, well-bred, and
delicate mannered lady.”</p>

</div>

<p>And in the “Home Journal” for April 6th
he published a severe review of the “Forrest
testimony,” warmly defending Mrs. Forrest, expressing
the belief that her husband’s chief
motive in the late proceedings had been to rid
himself of the expense of her support; that the
real cause of their separation had been his
jealousy of her intellectual superiority; and condemning
indignantly his attempt to “enlist
kitchen and brothel against her, and so sully her
fair name by cheap and easy falsehood that he
can throw her off like a mistress paid up to
parting.” The article concluded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have written the above under the editorial
plural, but the facts being mostly of personal knowledge,
and wishing to evade no manner of responsibility,
we close with the writer’s individual signature,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">N. P. Willis</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>These two articles, coupled with testimony
elicited from Forrest’s household servants, decided
him to drag Willis into the case. His
bill filed in Philadelphia contained the names of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
nine co-respondents, among them a clergyman,
Mrs. Forrest’s family doctor, and Forrest’s old
friend and traveling companion, Chevalier Wikoff.
The last three were afterwards dropped
from the case. Mrs. Forrest, having been served
with a copy of the application and the process
issued by the Pennsylvania legislature, filed a
bill in the New York Supreme Court in September,
1850, and obtained an injunction to restrain
her husband from proceeding with his suit in
Philadelphia. She then began suit against him
in New York for a divorce on the ground of
adultery, which he defended with cross-accusations;
and in New York the case was finally
tried and decided. Meanwhile Forrest was
prowling about his wife’s lodgings in New York,
threatening people who went in or out, and
stopping others in the street to warn them
against interference.</p>

<p>On the 17th of June, while Willis was walking
in Washington Square, near his own residence
in Fourth Street, Forrest came up to him
quickly and knocked him down with a blow from
his fist. He then stood over him, and, holding
him down by the coat collar with one hand, beat
him with a gutta-percha whip till the police came
up and interfered. To the group of spectators
which had rapidly assembled, he said, “That is
the seducer of my wife.” Willis would at no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
time have been physically the equal of his antagonist,
who was a man of powerful frame; but
when this assault was made it was doubly safe
from the fact that the victim of it had been ill for
months with a rheumatic fever, and was in an
unusually feeble condition of body. Two days
after this heroic action, Forrest met Bryant and
Godwin walking down Broadway and furiously
demanded who had put the account of it into the
“Evening Post,” in which he was represented as
having struck Willis from behind.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I told him,” said Mr. Godwin, in his testimony,
“I was responsible for the article. He then turned
round to me in a very ferocious way, and said there
were several things that he was going to hold me responsible
for; he said the article was a damned lie
from beginning to end; he said he meant to attack
Mr. Willis, and he believed that he had told me so
formerly. I replied that these were not just the terms
that he used, and that he told me formerly that he
meant to cut his damned heart out; to which Mr.
Forrest muttered something in reply&mdash;I don’t know
what it was distinctly; I think he said something
about what he would have done if they had not taken
him off.”</p>

</div>

<p>Willis brought an action against Forrest for
this assault, in the superior court of the city of
New York, and secured a verdict in March,
1852, for $2,500 and costs. The case was appealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
on exceptions, and, upon the new trial
which was ordered, the damages were reduced to
one dollar. Forrest sued Willis for libel in
the “Home Journal” article, and got $500 damages.
But in the mean time the suit for divorce
had come to trial, in December, 1851,
and had been decided in Mrs. Forrest’s favor.
The jury found the defendant guilty of adultery,
found the plaintiff innocent, and granted her the
decree prayed for with $3,000 a year alimony.
This was one of the <i lang="fr">causes célèbres</i> of the last
generation. The trial occupied the then extraordinarily
long period of six weeks, and the printed
testimony fills two large volumes. Charles
O’Conor, who was Mrs. Forrest’s counsel, dated
his great reputation as an advocate from his
conduct of this case. For eighteen years he
fought the battle for his fair client relentlessly
and triumphantly. The case was appealed five
times, and judgment affirmed every time with
an increase of alimony. It was not till 1868
that the defendant tired of resistance, and paid
over to the plaintiff the sum of $64,000. His
costs and expenses of litigation, additional to
this, were of course enormous. It is unnecessary
to review the evidence given at the trial, by
which it was sought to incriminate Willis in this
affair, further than to say that it consisted almost
solely of the testimony of servants, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
were thoroughly discredited in their cross-examination.
One of these witnesses was a man who
had been discharged from Willis’s employ. Another
was an ex-chambermaid in the Forrest
household, who was brought all the way from
Texas to testify, and who was shown to be a
thief, and the mother of an illegitimate child by
a friend of the defendant. Public opinion, it is
needless to say, was divided about the verdict.
Forrest was the idol of the Bowery, and the asserter
of the American stage against the “dudes”
and “Anglo-maniacs” of that day. “The boys,”
who had stuck by him in his quarrel with Macready
till its upshot in the bloody Astor Place
riot of May 10, 1849, stuck by him now in his
domestic tribulations, and gave him a rousing
ovation on his first appearance at the Broadway
Theatre, following the close of the trial.
A number of people in society, too, of those
who “demen gladly to the badder end,” made
up their minds to Mrs. Forrest’s guilt. But it
is not unfair to say that the great majority of
the decent people and respectable newspapers
greeted the verdict with acclamation. A large
party maintained that Forrest was a selfish and
licentious brute, who was tired of his wife and
wanted to be rid of her; that, knowing he had
no valid cause of action against her, he trumped
up charges and suborned witnesses. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
necessary to go so far as this in order to assert
the innocence of Mrs. Forrest and of those
who were made parties to the accusations against
her. Alger, in his big “Life of Edwin Forrest,”
after acknowledging that “the innocence
of Mrs. Forrest is publicly accredited, and is
not here impugned;” that she “was believed
by her intimate and most honored friends to be
innocent, was vindicated by a jury after a most
searching trial, and is now living in modest
and blameless retirement,” simply urges in Forrest’s
behalf that he honestly believed himself a
wronged man, and acted with his usual fury and
unforgivingness upon that conviction. Willis
and his brother were both among the witnesses
for the plaintiff on the trial, and both, of course,
denied peremptorily the charges against them.
But the one circumstance which more than all
else influenced the decision of the jury was the
constant presence in court of Mrs. N. P. Willis,
side by side with Mrs. Forrest, and the brave,
clear, and simple way in which she testified in
her friend’s behalf. No one could believe that a
spirited and refined lady, like Mrs. Willis, would
have consented, for an instant, to put herself
into such a position, without a full assurance of
her husband’s innocence; and no one who listened
to her testimony could have thought her a
woman likely to be deceived. John Van Buren,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
who was Forrest’s lawyer in all these cases, was
quite generally censured for the needlessly abusive
way in which he handled the witnesses for
the other side. In the trial of the assault and
battery case, “Willis <i lang="la">v.</i> Forrest,” his personalities
went so far beyond the limits usually set to
the licensed insolence of the bar, that on the
termination of the suit Willis, who was about
starting on a trip to the South, and had learned
from an item in the “Herald” that Van Buren
was going South too, sent him a letter demanding
an apology. In case he should decline to
make such apology, the letter proposed a hostile
meeting at Charleston or any other convenient
point in the Southern States. This note the recipient
returned (after carefully making a copy
of it) with a short reply, describing it as a “silly
and scurrilous communication.” This it certainly
was not, but, on the other hand, a very
dignified and gentlemanly letter; rather too
long, it must be owned, for on these occasions
Willis’s pen generally ran away with him.
However, on the receipt of this answer to it,
which was forwarded to him at the South, he replied
with sufficient brevity: “I now pronounce
you a coward, as well as a proper companion for
the blackguards whose attorneyship constitutes
your career.”</p>

<p>This challenge was something of a flourish on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Willis’s part, and his experience with Marryat
might have taught him the folly of such attempts
to get “the satisfaction of a gentleman” from
railing editors and attorneys. He took little by
his motion, which simply gave Van Buren an
opportunity to publish the correspondence in a
New York morning paper with comments of his
own, characteristically ugly and characteristically
smart. The fact remained, however, that
Van Buren had been challenged to fight and
had declined, and the general note made upon
the affair by a venal press was to the effect that
“Prince John had shown the white feather.”
Of the many letters of sympathy and congratulation
received by Mr. and Mrs. Willis after
the Forrest verdict, the following, from Mr. J.
P. Kennedy, the author of “Swallow Barn,”
will serve as an example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Baltimore</span>, <i>February 2, 1852</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Willis</span>,&mdash;I have often resolved during
the war&mdash;the <em>late</em> war, I hope I may call it&mdash;to assume
the privilege of a friend and send you the only
succor I could supply, a word of comfort and a cheer
or two, to let you see that there was some sympathy
abroad for your sufferings, which I know were pungent
enough to make a very respectable saint, if your
ambition lay in that way. Now that you have got
through certainly the worst part of your Iliad in the
termination of that horrible trial, I think it a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
time to redeem my promise to myself, and to say to
you that I have felt a friend’s part in the whole progress
of your troubles, and the confidence of a friend
that the end would bring you a bright sky and a
pleasant outlook for the future. I particularly congratulate
Mrs. Willis on this result, as I know, or
can imagine, the full measure of her griefs. We <em>all
here</em>&mdash;I mean our household, with whom Mrs. Willis
is associated in so many affectionate remembrances&mdash;unite
very sincerely in this message to her. Your
defense in the “Home Journal” of an injured woman,
which I noted and applauded from the first, was, at
its least, a manly and generous act, and it became the
more worthy of your manhood as it grew to be perilous.
I use this word much more in reference to the
social clamor than to the ruffian assault it brought
you. I trust you are now to triumph very signally
over both. Present Mrs. Kennedy and her sister very
kindly to your wife, as also Dr. Gray, and believe me</p>

<p class="center">Very truly yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">J. P. Kennedy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The result of the Forrest trial was, in a sense,
a triumph for Willis. Yet in all affairs of the
kind, although the charges are disproved, the
very fact that they have been made leaves, illogically
and unfairly, perhaps, but still inevitably,
a sediment of prejudice in the public mind.
It is in the nature of such cases that the inmost
truth about them can seldom be known to more
than two persons. To all others there remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
nothing beyond inference and suspicion. Hence
the uncertainty which survives the judicial decision
of the cause and works injustice to the
innocent who have been unlucky enough to be
drawn into compromising situations. An impression
has always obtained in many quarters
that Willis was profligate in his relations with
women. Rumors to this effect were industriously
circulated by his ill-wishers, and, in one
instance, they got into print in the shape of an
accusation publicly brought against him by his
ancient foe, Colonel James Watson Webb of the
“Courier and Enquirer.” It is needless to revive
this venerable scandal or any of the less
tangible, miscellaneous gossip once afloat on the
current of New York society. It is no part of
a biographer’s duty to “vindicate” his subject
from any and all charges of the kind. I have
read the published documents in the Webb-Willis
affair with a sincere effort to be impartial,
and they left upon my mind no impression
of anything worse on Willis’s part than vanity
and indiscretion in permitting himself to be
drawn into a half literary, half sentimental correspondence
with a very romantic young woman,
without her parents’ knowledge. He was easily
flattered by attentions from female worshipers
of genius. He maintained in print and in person
a constant attitude of gallantry toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
sex, which doubtless stimulated the rumor of his
immoralities, and led the reader to identify him
with the Lotharios of his tales. Moreover, it
is not to be denied that when a young man in
Italy, and in the fast set of his London acquaintances,
he was exposed to temptations which he
did not always resist, and probably had his
share of those adventures which the French indulgently
call <i lang="fr">bonnes fortunes</i>, but less liberal
shepherds of Anglo-Saxon race give a grosser
name; and which always turn out the reverse
of good fortunes for everybody concerned. As
to his later life, one who knew him well but had
quarreled with him and had small cause to like
him, writes: “My belief is that N. P. Willis
was, as he said, perfectly free from fault in that
business [the Forrest affair], and had <em>no</em> intrigues
with women after his marriage.”</p>

<p>The spring of 1852 found him much broken
in health. He had a wearing cough, and it was
thought that his lungs were diseased. He waited
only the termination of his assault and battery
case in March, to start on a journey to the South
with his father-in-law, Mr. Grinnell. The trip
included a cruise to Bermuda and the West
Indies, a short stay in Charleston, Savannah,
and New Orleans, a visit to the Mammoth Cave,
and a sojourn at the neighboring watering-place
of Harrodsburg Springs. His letters to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
“Home Journal” from these and other points
in the South were reissued in book form as “A
Health Trip to the Tropics.” During the years
covered by this chapter he published a number
of volumes similarly made up of periodical correspondence
and miscellaneous contributions to
his paper. “Rural Letters” contained his “Invalid
Letters from Germany;” a reprint of “Letters
from under a Bridge,” with two additional
to those in the earlier editions; “Open Air
Musings in the City;” letters from Sharon
Springs and Trenton Falls in the summer of
1848; and one story, “A Plain Man’s Love.”
“Hurrygraphs” comprised a series of letters
from Plymouth, New Bedford, Cape Cod, and
places on the Delaware and Hudson rivers; besides
sketches&mdash;often very acute pieces of mental
portraiture&mdash;of public men, authors, and
other celebrities, and a good deal of chit-chat
about society, the opera, etc., from the columns
of the “Home Journal.”</p>

<p>All that can be said of these traveler’s letters
is that they are fairly good reporting. They
hardly attain the rank of literature, and were as
a whole not worth putting between covers. But
Willis sold well and, therefore, found his account
in continued book-making, bringing out, usually,
simultaneous editions in London and New
York. It is instructive to compare his letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
from Cape Cod&mdash;a journey on which Mr. Grinnell
was again his companion&mdash;with Thoreau’s
book on the same piece of geography. Both
men had quick eyes, and had taught themselves
the art of observation. But Willis’s letters were
the notes of an “amateur casual,” or “here-and-thereian,”
on a flying trip over a sand-spit inhabited
by queer people, who was always on the
lookout for points which would interest the lady
readers of a metropolitan journal. Thoreau, on
the contrary, was like a palmer on a solemn pilgrimage
to one of nature’s peculiar shrines, with
loins girt up and staff in hand, tramping along
the heavy sands, with the eternal thunder of
“The Reverend Poluphloisboio Thalasses” in
his ear; in serious and vigilant mood, watching
every least token of the ways of the sea, but
careless of men and reading publics.</p>

<p>Now and then there is a quaint or poetic
fancy in these itineraries of Willis which recalls
his youthful manner; as where, speaking of the
absence of an atmosphere in the tropic seas, he
says: “As to the horizon, it seems so near that,
if you were washing your hands on deck, you
might try to throw the slops over it, as you
would over the ship’s side. The sun goes down,
as it were, next door.” In the letters from Trenton
Falls&mdash;which he had visited twenty years
before and described in “Edith Linsey”&mdash;occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
a startling anticipation of the most admired
figure in Tennyson’s “Queen Mary:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As we stood gazing at this, last night, a little after
midnight, the moon threw the shadow of the rock
slantwise across the face of the fall. I found myself
insensibly watching to see whether the delicate outline
of the shadow would not vary. There it lay, still
as the shade of a church window across a marble slab
on the wall, drawing its fine line over the most frenzied
tumult of the lashed and agonized waters, and
dividing whatever leapt across it, foam, spray, or driving
mist, with invariable truthfulness to the rock that
lay behind. Now, my song-maker, if you ever have
a great man to make famous&mdash;a hero who unflinchingly
represents a great principle amid the raging opposition,
hatred, and malice of mankind&mdash;there is
your similitude: <em>Calm as the shadow of a rock across
the foam of a cataract</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Willis was induced by Mr. Moore, the proprietor
and landlord, to edit a small illustrated
guide-book to Trenton Falls; his own contributions
to which consisted of descriptions reproduced
from these letters and from “Edith Linsey,”
and a short biography of the Rev. John
Sherman, the first settler and a grandson of
Roger Sherman. In the same way and in the
same year (1851) he put together a little “Life
of Jenny Lind,” for whom he had an ardent admiration,
and whom he had been privileged to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
often and familiarly during her first visit to
America. This was, of course, not a formal biography,
but was made up from articles that he
had written about her from time to time for the
“Home Journal,” and extracts from the English
papers. He also issued selections from his former
volumes under new names. Such were
“People I have Met,” and “Life Here and
There,” which were stories from “Dashes at
Life,” and contained little or nothing new, and
“A Summer Cruise in the Mediterranean,”
which was a mere reprint of a part of “Pencillings
by the Way.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
1853-1867.<br />
<span class="smaller">IDLEWILD AND LAST DAYS.</span></h2>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Willis, with their children, had
passed the summer of 1850 at Cornwall, in the
highlands of the Hudson, boarding at the farmhouse
of a Mrs. Sutherland. They grew so attached
to the beautiful neighborhood that they
resolved to make it their home some day, and
with this in view, in the fall of the same year,
they had bought the fifty acres of land which
afterwards became widely known as Idlewild.
This little domain lay upon a shelf or terrace on
the western bank of the Hudson, lifted some
two hundred feet above the level of the river,
at the point where its waters received the slender
tribute of Moodna Creek. Behind the site
chosen for the house was a wild ravine, shaded
by hemlocks, at the bottom of which a brook,
swollen to sizable rapids and cascades by the
spring freshets, but a mere trickle in midsummer,
ran down to join the creek. The location
seemed destined by nature for a gentleman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
country seat, from its variety of surface, its contrasting
prospects, and its noble timber. The
outlook in front was upon a wide bend of the
river and the opposite heights and distant mountain
perspectives of the eastern shore. Behind
the house was a private landscape of glen and
forest, sunk away quite out of sight of the sails
and steamers that passed continually up and
down the watery highway before the front door.
To the south, a mile away, was the imposing
shape of Storm King, a mountain which owes
its baptism to Willis, having previously figured
in geography as Butter Hill. Four miles below
this were West Point and the gate of the highlands,
and on the other bank General Morris’s
summer home of Undercliff. Four miles above
Idlewild was the considerable town of Newburg,
for a market; and only a mile from his door,
the post office village of Moodna.</p>

<p>Willis’s trip to the tropics had been of small
benefit to his health, and, on his return in the
summer of 1852, he joined his family at their
boarding place at Cornwall. His doctor warned
him that a return to New York would be at the
risk of his life. He had grown tired, himself,
of the city and of gay society, and longed for
the repose of the hills. <i lang="la">Levavit oculos ad arces.</i>
In the hope that rural quiet and the drier air of
the highlands might restore his health, he decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
that autumn to begin building at once, and
to take up his permanent abode in the country.
During the winter and spring he remained with
his family at the Sutherlands’, and busied himself
in superintending the erection of his house,
laying out roads and paths, cutting vistas through
his trees, building stone walls, constructing a
dam for his brook, and reporting progress in
gossipy letters to the “Home Journal.” In the
spring of 1853 the New York house was sold,
and on the 26th of July Idlewild received its
tenants.</p>

<p>Willis had a happy knack at inventing names,
and if everything that he wrote should become
obsolete, he will still have left his sign manual
on the American landscape and the English
tongue. “Idlewild” was an apt and beautiful
name, and like Sunnyside, the place became and
remains one of the historic points of the scenery
of the Hudson. The story that Willis tells of
the origin of the word is this: The old farmer
and fisherman who owned the land&mdash;uncle of
the “Ward boys,” of aquatic fame&mdash;was showing
him over the property, and Willis, inquiring
the price of this particular piece, was answered
that it had little value, being “an idle wild of
which nothing could ever be made.” I fancy
that this little anecdote is in part a myth, invented
after the fact to give the name a history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
and a justification. Willis was particular, not
to say fussy, in such matters, and the title finally
chosen was obtained by a process of elimination
from a list that I have seen, of several hundred
“pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,” such as
Everwild, Mieux-ici, Lodore, Loudwater, Idle-brook,
Wanderwild, Up-the-brook, Shadywild,
Loiterwild, Demijour-brook, etc.</p>

<p>Thus ten years after the break-up of his home
at Glenmary, he had again pitched his pavilion&mdash;this
time for good&mdash;by green pastures and
running waters. Henceforth he abjured fashionable
life and devoted himself to the domesticities;
to the care of his health and his grounds,
the entertainment of his guests, and the preparation
of his weekly letter to the “Home Journal.”
There was little left in him of that dandyism
which had distressed his critics. But the
old coats and hats which he loved to wear were
worn with a certain grace peculiar to the man.
He could not put on the seediest garment without
straightway imparting to it an air of jauntiness.
He was fond of pets and was a most playful
and affectionate companion to his children,
the number of whom gradually increased to five
by the birth of a third daughter, Edith, on September
28, 1853, and a second son, Bailey, on
May 31, 1857. All of these survive, but his
last child, a daughter, born October 31, 1860,
lived only a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>From early spring till after Christmas the
family at Idlewild kept open house, having almost
always company staying with them, and in
summer constantly receiving transient guests.
The place had become celebrated through Willis’s
descriptions in the “Home Journal.” Cornwall
was growing to be a summer resort, and
there were daily visits to the glen and to the
house from all manner of people. Willis’s
habit was to breakfast in his own room and
write till noon. Sometimes he would take a
stroll to the post office or the glen before dinner.
After dinner he would write letters or do “scissors
work” before the afternoon drive or ride.
The evening was spent with his guests, or, if the
family were alone, he would write again and
come down to a nine o’clock supper.</p>

<p>From the trivial incidents of this daily life he
wove his correspondence; enough of it, at last,
to fill two volumes, “Out Doors at Idlewild”
and “The Convalescent;” the former dedicated
to Mr. Grinnell, the latter to Doctors William
Beattie and John F. Gray, his physicians, and
both books addressed more particularly to the
author’s “parish of invalids.” These letters
have by no means the literary merit of the “Letters
from under a Bridge,” and it was, perhaps,
presuming too far on their claim to even contemporary
respect to bind them up at all after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
they had once done duty in the newspaper column.
They were eagerly read, nevertheless, as
they appeared from week to week, and a sympathetic
public was interested in Willis’s kindly
prattle about his landscape gardening, his tree
planting, the deluges in his brook, his children,
his horses and dogs, the eccentricities of his
country neighbors, the humors of his poultry,
the daily voyage of the family wagon to Newburg,
the sleighing on the frozen Hudson, and
the occasional picnics and excursions to Storm
King, West Point, Poughkeepsie, or remoter
points. Willis found himself not without amusement,
becoming something of a country gentleman
and public-spirited bulwark of society,
taking part in local interests. There was a picturesque
little Episcopal church a mile from
Idlewild, in which he became a vestryman and
used to pass the plate. Once he even made a
speech at a public meeting, in favor of dividing
the county. Letters <span class="smcapuc">XXXIX.</span> and <span class="smcapuc">XL.</span> in “Out
Doors at Idlewild,” giving a graphic description
of the ascent of Storm King, are perhaps the
best thing in the volume.</p>

<p>Among the many guests attracted to Idlewild
by the hospitalities of its owner and his inviting
pictures of his highland retreat were numbers
of literary men and artists.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Bayard Taylor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Charles A. Dana, De Trobriand, of the “Courrier
des États-Unis;” Hicks and Kensett, the
painters, came up from New York at various
times, and rambled, bathed, or otherwise disported
themselves in the glen. Whipple and
Fields ran across from Boston and made a pleasant
visit of two or three days, of which both afterwards
gave reminiscences. Fields loved to
recall an anecdote that Willis told him, “of his
watching a little ragged girl, one day in London,
who was peering through an area railing. A
window of a comfortable eating-house gave upon
this area, and a man sat at the window taking
a good dinner. The child watched his every
movement, saw him take a beefsteak and get all
things in readiness to begin; then he stopped and
looked round. ‘Now a pertaty,’ murmured the
child.”</p>

<p>In the summer of 1854, Willis had a call
from his down-river neighbor, Washington Irving,
and repaid it at Sunnyside in 1859, in company
with J. P. Kennedy and Lieutenant Wise,
the author of “Los Gringos,” who had both
been passing a day or two with him at Idlewild.
Irving drove them through Sleepy Hollow, as
recounted in “The Convalescent,” in which this
visit fills an agreeable chapter; and Willis characteristically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
begged his host to give him his
blotting-sheet for memorabilia, as being “the
door-mat on which the thoughts of Irving’s last
book had wiped their sandals as they went in.”
“The Convalescent” (1859) was the last book
which Willis published, if we except some late
editions of his poems, but there are gleams in it,
here and there, of the wit and fancy that never
quite forsook him. There was, for instance, a
long and very dark covered bridge over Moodna
Creek, which he always entered with dread,
when on horseback, and which he described as
giving “a promise of emergence to light on the
other side, which required the faith of a gimlet.”
Upon the whole, it would be a very difficult
reader who should refuse to admit the plea
which the author urges in behalf of books of
“The Convalescent” kind. “I learned also, to
my comfort, that Nature publishes some volumes
with many leaves, which are not intended to be
of any posthumous value&mdash;the white poplar not
lasting three moonlight nights after it is cut
down. Even with such speedy decay, however,
it throws a pleasant shade while it flourishes;
and so, white poplar literature, recognized as a
class in literature, should have its brief summer
of indulgence.”</p>

<p>Willis found that his best medicine was horseback
riding, and spent as many hours as he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
in the saddle. His horses and dogs were a great
source of amusement to him. One of his special
pets was Cæsar, a superb Newfoundland,
that had been with Dr. Kane on one of his Arctic
voyages, and was afterwards presented to
Willis. When it died its grave at Idlewild was
marked by a marble slab, the gift of Brown, the
famous Grace Church sexton, with an epitaph of
his own composition. The slab was on exhibition
for a time, in July, 1862, at Barnum’s museum,
and the inscription on it ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CÆSAR,<br />

<p>In 1854 a book was published which became
the occasion of many heart-burnings, and of accusations
against Willis that have not yet ceased
to go the rounds of the newspapers. This was
“Ruth Hall, a Domestic Tale of the Present
Time,” by Fanny Fern. The lady who wrote
under this pen name was his younger sister, Sarah,
the author of much cleverish literature&mdash;“Fern
Leaves,” and the like&mdash;which once enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
a prodigious circulation. She was the <i lang="fr">enfant
terrible</i> of the family, a warm-hearted, impulsive
woman, but not always discreet. By the
death of her husband, Charles Eldridge of Boston,
she had been suddenly reduced from comfort
to poverty. She afterwards contracted an
unfortunate marriage with a Mr. Farrington,
from whom she was finally divorced. To support
herself and her children, she turned instinctively
to literature, in which she at last made a
decided hit. Among other things she offered
some contributions to the “Home Journal;”
but Willis, whose literary taste, though certainly
not severe, was fastidious in its way, could not
see merit enough in his sister’s writing, and disliked
what he regarded as its noisy, rattling
style. He felt obliged to decline her articles,
but that there was any literary jealousy in this,
as is intimated in “Ruth Hall,” will hardly be
believed, when his eagerness to welcome and
patronize young writers is remembered. It
seems to have sprung from an original opposition
in character and taste between the two. But it
naturally made hard feeling and led to recriminations.
Mr. James Parton, who was then sub-editor
of the “Home Journal,” took Fanny
Fern’s part, and the acquaintance thus begun
soon ripened into an engagement of marriage.
There was a scene, in consequence, in the office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of the “Home Journal,” and Mr. Parton retired
from the paper, his place being supplied by Mr.
T. B. Aldrich. Smarting under a sense of neglect
by her kinsfolk, Fanny Fern wrote and
printed this novel of “Ruth Hall,” in which,
under a very thin mask of fiction, she washed
a deal of family linen in public. Willis figures
therein as Hyacinth, a “heartless puppy,” who
worships social position, has married an heiress,
inhabits a villa on the Hudson, and is the prosperous
editor of the “Irving Magazine.” When
Ruth asks him to help her by printing her pieces
in this periodical, he coldly assures her that she
has no talent, and advises her to seek “some
unobtrusive employment.” But when she becomes
famous and begins to get letters from
college presidents, begging her for her autograph,
and from grateful readers, saying, “I
am a better son, a better brother, a better husband,
and a better father than I was before I
commenced reading your articles. God bless
you!” then, under these triumphant circumstances,
Hyacinth, who had given $100 for a
vase when Ruth was starving, is proud to point
out to a friend, as they sit together in the porch
of his country seat, a beautiful schooner tacking
up stream with “Floy,” his sister’s <i lang="fr">nom-de-plume</i>,
painted on the bows.</p>

<p>Against this caricature of himself Willis made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
no public protest. When a man is wounded in
the house of his friends, his only refuge is silence.
But in private and to his intimates he
asserted that the attack upon him in “Ruth
Hall” was most unfair; that he <em>had</em> helped his
sister in the early days of her widowhood, but
that after her second marriage and divorce he
had ceased to have any communication with her,
and felt justified in letting her alone. Willis
was doubtless a man who took his responsibilities
lightly. But had he felt called upon to do
his utmost for Fanny Fern, even to the end, it is
easy to see how his hands were tied in various
ways. He had an expensive family of his own,
whose support depended upon his pen. His
home on the Hudson had been purchased with
his wife’s inheritance. As to paying his sister
for articles in the “Home Journal,” supposing
them to have been otherwise acceptable, the
editors were constantly reiterating that the paper
did not, as a rule, pay its contributors anything,
and could not afford to do so. It paid its
own editorial staff, and that was all. Contributors
were glad to write for it for the pleasure
of seeing themselves in print.</p>

<p>Willis continued to put forth permutations
and combinations of old matter under new titles,
as long as his books would sell. “Fun Jottings,”
“Ephemera,” “Famous Persons and Places,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and “The Rag-Bag” were all made up from the
contents of previous volumes, or the teeming
sheets of the “Mirror” and “Home Journal.”
But in 1857 he published something new, “Paul
Fane,” his only novel, and the only book which
he wrote as a book, and not as one or more contributions
to periodicals. So exclusively a <i lang="fr">feuilletoniste</i>
had he made himself, that any talent
for construction on a larger scale which he may
once have had was quite frittered away.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It has been with difficult submission to marketableness,”
he had written in his preface to “Dashes
at Life,” “that the author has broken up his statues
at the joints and furnished each fragment with head
and legs to walk alone. Continually accumulating
material, with the desire to produce a work of fiction,
he was as continually tempted by extravagant prices
to shape these separate forms of society and character
into tales for periodicals; and between two persuaders&mdash;the
law of copyright, on the one hand, providing
that American books at fair prices should compete
with books to be had for nothing; and necessity, on
the other hand, pleading much more potently than the
ambition for an adult stature in literary fame&mdash;he
has gone on acquiring a habit of dashing off for a
magazine any chance view of life that turned up to
him, and selling in fragmentary chapters what should
have been kept together, and moulded into a proportionate
work of imagination.”</p>

</div>

<p>If “Paul Fane, or Parts of a Life Else Untold”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
was a response to this artistic craving for
unity in a sustained work, its author had waited
too late. It was, in effect, a poor novel; and&mdash;what
was unusual with Willis, even at his
thinnest&mdash;it was dull. The story is told in the
first person, and the hero is a young American
artist, who, feeling his social equality challenged
by a look in the eyes of a cold English girl
of high birth, is driven abroad by a restless determination
to put himself on a level with any
nobility that hereditary rank can bestow. He
brings the haughtiest daughters of Albion to his
feet. Three or four women fall in love with
him, including the original offender and her
aunt, but he will none of them. It is Willis’s
old theme of nature’s nobleman versus caste.
The novel was an experiment, before the times
were ripe, in that field of international manners
which has since been so cleverly occupied by
Henry James. It tries to deal with the perplexities
and real miseries, which arise not so
much from the deeper conflicts of character as
from the attempt to adjust hostile social standards.
Mr. James has made a very interesting
story out of the simple episode of a young English
lady marrying an American, coming to
America to live, and then, not finding American
ways to her taste, taking her husband back to
England with her. But Willis was not well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
equipped for success in this field. He could not
keep his fancy in check; there must be a dash of
romance, of exaggeration in his tale. And he
was a quick observer rather than a patient student
of manners, as of other things. He lacked
the sober, truthful vigilance of James and Howells.
Miss Firkin, in this book, an overdone
Daisy Miller, and Blivins, an American type
once rumored to have existed, but inconceivable
at this distance of time, show how far his execution
fell below the fine and solid work of our
contemporary realists. There are passages of
vulgarity in “Paul Fane” which are a surprise
in any book of Willis’s, but which came rather
from the weakness and failure of his hand in its
attempt to execute scenes of broad humor, than
from any crudity of feeling. This kind of violent
and assumed indelicacy on the part of naturally
refined writers, when they are trying to
put on the healthy coarseness of a Hogarth or
Teniers, is a not uncommon phenomenon; daintiness
mistaking coarseness for the strength of
which it is often a sign or an accompaniment.</p>

<p>In “The Convalescent” were included narratives
of a trip to the Rappahannock, to Nantucket,
and to the horse fair at Springfield, Massachusetts.
In July, 1860, Willis accompanied
Mr. Grinnell on a journey to the West,&mdash;reported
for the “Home Journal” as a “Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Weeks’ Trip to the West,”&mdash;going to Yellow
Springs, Ohio, and Chicago, and as far as Madison,
Wisconsin; then descending the Mississippi
in a steamboat to St. Louis, and returning East
by way of Cincinnati and Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>In Willis’s later writings his verbal affectations
gained upon him to an intolerable extent.
“Mr. N. P. Willis,” says Bartlett in his “Dictionary
of Americanisms,” “has the reputation
of inventing many new words, some of which,
though not yet embodied in our dictionaries, are
much used in familiar language.” One of the
phrases which Bartlett accredits to him is, “the
upper ten,”&mdash;originally and in full, “the upper
ten thousand of New York city.” This seems
likely to keep its place in the language. “Japonicadom”
took at the time, but has now gone
out. He had a fondness for agglutinations.
“Come-at-able” is a convenient word which is
traced to his mint; and Professor George P.
Marsh, in his “Origin and History of the English
Language,” lends the weight of his authority
to Willis’s “Stay-at-home-itiveness,” as a
synonym for the Greek οἰκουρία, and the early
English <i>studestapelvestnesse</i>. But such philological
monsters as re-June-venescence, worthwhile-ativeness,
fifty-per-centity, with which
some of his books are strewn, have a painfully
forced effect, and the trick became, from repetition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
a tedious mannerism. Punning, likewise,
was a habit which grew upon him, though both of
these offenses are commoner in his private correspondence
than in his published work.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the civil war in the spring
of 1861, there was a rush of newspaper men
to Washington. It was decided that the “Home
Journal,” too, should have its war correspondent,
and accordingly Willis, bidding good-by to Idlewild,
flung himself into the tide of journalists,
soldiers, politicians, office-seekers, contractors,
and speculators of all sorts, setting toward the
seat of government. At Baltimore he stayed over
a day with his friend Kennedy, who was prominently
mentioned for the secretaryship of the
navy, and who went on to Washington with Willis,
where the latter introduced him and Reverdy
Johnson to Mrs. Lincoln. The feeding of the
“Home Journal” press with “Lookings-on at
the War” proved a longer job than Willis had
anticipated. It kept him in Washington for
over a year, with occasional furloughs for a hurried
visit home. He had always been curiously
indifferent to politics. His opinions had been
Whiggish, and he was, of course, a Union man.
But he retained a secret sympathy with the
South, and a liking for “those chivalrous, polysyllabic
Southerners, incapable of a short word or
a mean action,” whom he had known at Saratoga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
years before. Nevertheless, he dropped his light
plummet of observation into the boiling sea of
the civil war, where it was tossed about at no
great depth below the surface. It is interesting
to compare his letters from the capital with the
patriotic fervor and swing of such martial
sketches as Theodore Winthrop’s “Washington
as a Camp.” The war, indeed, may be said to
have made Willis and the kind of literature
which he cultivated obsolete for a time. A
more earnest generation of writers had come to
the fore, who struck their roots deeper down into
the life of the nation. Mr. Derby, the publisher,
proposed in 1863 to make a book out of Willis’s
“Lookings-on at the War,” but the project
hung fire for some reason, and “The Convalescent”
remained, as has been said, his last publication
in book form.</p>

<p>Willis found all the world at Washington;
among the rest, Lady Georgiana Fane, whom he
presented to Mrs. Lincoln. “Fancy anticipating
this at Almack’s twenty-five years ago!” he
wrote of this conjunction, in a letter to Mrs. Willis.
He met Charles Sumner, whom he had
known in Boston, and had a long talk with him
about the political situation; found Pierpont,
the poet, employed as a clerk in one of the departments,
and got rooms for him and Mrs.
Pierpont in the house where he lodged himself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
was introduced to General McClellan and to the
cabinet officers, and the numerous congressmen
and brigadiers who swarmed Pennsylvania Avenue
and crowded the lobbies at Willard’s. He
went out to all manner of receptions and dinner
parties, and became quite a favorite with Mrs.
Lincoln, who drove him out frequently in her
barouche, had him to dine <i lang="fr">en famille</i> at the
White House, sent him flowers, and promised
him a vase presented to the President by the
Emperor of China. In one of his letters to the
“Home Journal,” he had described her as having
a “motherly expression,” whereupon she addressed
him the following note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Executive Mansion</span>, <i>July 24th</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Mr. N. P. Willis</span>:</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,&mdash;It will afford me much pleasure to
receive yourself and ladies<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> this evening. Of course
anything Mr. Willis writes is interesting, yet, pardon
my weakness, I object to the “motherly expression.”
If you value my friendship, hasten to have it corrected
before the public is assured that I am an old
lady with <em>spectacles</em>. When I am <em>forty</em>, four years
hence, I will willingly yield to the decrees of <em>time</em> and
fate.</p>

<p>Rather an indication, is it not, that years have not
passed <em>us</em> lightly by? I rely on you for changing
that expression before my age is <em>publicly</em> proclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Quite a morning lecture, yet you certainly deserve it.
Be kind enough to accept this modest bouquet from</p>

<p class="center">Your sincere friend,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mary Lincoln</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>A sudden fit of sickness had hindered Willis’s
plan to follow the army to Bull Run&mdash;fortunately,
no doubt, as the correspondent who took
his place was made prisoner. He afterwards
took horseback rides into the enemy’s country,
once narrowly escaping capture near Mount
Vernon, and made excursions to Fortress Monroe,
Manassas, Old Point Comfort, etc. On
March 15, 1862, he was of the party which visited
Harper’s Ferry at the invitation of the
president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.
Hawthorne, too, was of the party and reported
the occasion in his article, “Chiefly about War
Matters,” in the July “Atlantic” of that year.
“Hawthorne is shy and reserved,” wrote Willis
in one of his letters to his wife, “but I found
he was a lover of mine, and we enjoyed our acquaintance
very much.” Emerson and Curtis
lectured in Washington while Willis was there,
and Greeley dined with him in January, 1862.
The novelty and excitement of life at the capital
were agreeable at first, but he soon grew
homesick and pined for his beloved Idlewild.</p>

<p>In consequence of the war, the circulation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
the “Home Journal,” a large proportion of
whose subscribers were in the South, had fallen
off seriously. Willis found himself greatly
straitened, and was obliged to close his country
house for a time. Mrs. Willis and the children
had spent the winter and spring of 1861-62 at
New Bedford, with her father. In April she
rented Idlewild and went with her family to pass
the summer at Campton, near Plymouth, New
Hampshire. In June Willis left Washington and
joined her at Campton for a few days, and then
returned to New York and took lodgings for
himself. Morris’s health had grown so feeble
that it became necessary for his partner to apply
himself more closely to the management of the
paper and do double work. He had been much
opposed to the renting of Idlewild, and it troubled
him to think of the place in the hands of
strangers. He paid it a visit in August, by invitation
of his tenant, a Mr. Dennis, and was
very hospitably treated. In the autumn of the
following year (1863) Mrs. Willis opened at
Idlewild a little school for girls, in the hope of
persuading her husband to leave New York and
come home for life. He appreciated her energy
and devotion,&mdash;shown through long years of
failing health and fortune,&mdash;but he doomed
himself to homeless exile, and refused to abandon
his post. He was opposed to the school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
project, as he had been to the renting of Idlewild,
unreasonably, no doubt, since something
of the kind had to be done. But it touched
his pride, and with increasing illness there grew
upon him a morbid horror of dependence on
any one. He fancied that he could work better
in his New York lodgings. By 1864, moreover,
Morris had become quite imbecile, and
the responsibilities of editorship weighed more
and more heavily on Willis. He remained at
New York, therefore, running up to Idlewild
for an occasional visit of a day or two, over
Sunday, or sometimes for a week at a time.
In July, 1864, General Morris died. Willis
was deeply moved as he stood by his coffin.
“My beloved old friend,” he wrote, “looked
wonderfully tranquil, and so sweetly noble that I
could not forbear giving him a parting kiss,
though William sobbed as he looked on. So
passes from earth one who loved me devotedly.”
After Morris’s death Willis took into partnership
a young man named Hollister, who had
capital and enthusiasm; but the business management
of the “Home Journal” began to fall
more and more upon the shoulders of its present
editor, Mr. Morris Phillips.</p>

<p>The story of the last few years of Willis’s
life is a melancholy chronicle of failing powers,
and of persistent struggle with disease and narrowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
fates. He had long borne up against ill
health with the gay courage of a cavalier. His
pen faltered, but nothing that it wrote gave
signs of bitterness or discouragement. Toward
the last his temper, which had been uniformly
sweet, sometimes grew irritable and morbid,
though nothing of this appeared in his writing.
As early as 1852 he had fancied that he had
consumption, but his cough turned out to be
merely “sympathetic,” and his lungs were pronounced
sound. His disease finally declared itself
as epilepsy, and resulted at the last in paralysis
and softening of the brain. He was
subject for years to epileptic fits, occurring periodically,
usually on the tenth day. During
these attacks, so long as his strength lasted, he
was extremely violent, but as he grew weaker,
they simply made him unconscious, leaving him
greatly prostrated when the fit was over. The
true nature of his malady was, for some years,
known only to his wife and his physician, Dr.
Gray, who feared that it might injure Willis’s
business and literary interests if it were publicly
understood that his brain was affected, or in
danger of being affected. Willis was himself
very sensitive on this point, and begged that no
stranger might see him during his attacks. Accordingly,
the matter was kept secret as long as
possible. After Willis’s death, one of his physicians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Dr. J. B. F. Walker, printed some
“Medical Reminiscences of N. P. Willis,” in
the course of which he said: “Not only was he a
martyr to the agonies of sharp and sudden attacks,
but he suffered all the languors of chronic
disease. With the exception of Henry Heine,
there has hardly been a man of letters doomed
to such protracted torments from bodily disease.”</p>

<p>Under these trying circumstances he exhibited
a persistence in his work which astonished his
friends. They had not thought that such endurance
was in the man. But from some underlying
stratum of character, some strain of toughness
inherent in his Puritan stock, he brought
up resources of will and stubbornness which resisted
all appeals. Though complaining sometimes
in his letters that he was “pitilessly overworked,”
he declared his intention of dying in
harness, and clung to his desk and his lonely
lodgings till the doctors pronounced him a dying
man. A part of the summers of 1865 and 1866
he spent at Idlewild, but the autumn of the latter
year found him still at work in the city. He
was now so weak that he often fainted in the
street and had to be carried to his rooms. His
partner, Morris Phillips, was untiring in his attentions;
and finally, early in November, he
brought him home to Idlewild, Willis yielding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
at last to the united entreaties of his wife, his
father, and his sisters, and the imperative command
of his doctor, to stop work. But he had
come home only to die. He kept his room and
seldom went down-stairs. During the first month
he had some enjoyment of the home associations,
taking pleasure in the daily visit of his children,
and listening to the reading of poetry, more for
its soothing effect than for any intellectual apprehension
of it. He soon became helpless and
slept much of the time, and when waking lived in
continual visions and hallucinations. His recognition
of his family was fitful during the last
six or eight weeks of his life. He was watched
and cared for by his wife and faithful Harriet,
and no strange hand ministered to him or
marked his failing consciousness. He died on
the afternoon of the 20th of January, 1867,&mdash;his
sixty-first birthday,&mdash;so quietly that the single
watcher could not say when. He was taken
to Boston, and buried in Mount Auburn. The
funeral service of the Episcopal Church was
read over his body in St. Paul’s Church, by the
Rev. P. D. Huntington, the bookstores of the
city being closed, in token of respect, while
the service lasted. His pall was borne by Longfellow,
Dana, Holmes, Lowell, Fields, Whipple,
Edmund Quincy, Dr. Howe, Merritt Trimble,
and Aldrich. “I took the flower which lies before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
me at this moment, as I write,” says Dr.
Holmes, in a recent number of the “Atlantic,”
“from his coffin, as it lay just outside the door
of Saint Paul’s Church, on a sad, overclouded
winter’s day, in the year 1867.”</p>

<p>The obituary notices which were published after
Willis’s death made it evident that he had,
in a sense, survived his own fame. They were
reminiscent in tone, as though addressed to a
generation that knew not Joseph. It was forty
years since he had come before the public with
his maiden book. It was twenty since he had
put forth anything entitled to live; and meanwhile
a new literature had grown up in America.
The bells of morning tinkled faintly and far off,
lost in the noise of fife and drum, and the war
opened its chasm between the present and the
past. For a time even Irving seemed sentimental
and Cooper melodramatic. Yet these survive,
but whether Willis, whose name has so
often been joined with theirs, is destined to find
still a hearing, it is for the future alone to say.
“He will be remembered,” wrote his kinsman,
Dr. Richard S. Storrs, “as a man eminently human,
with almost unique endowments, devoting
rare powers to insignificant purposes, and curiously
illustrating the ‘fine irony of Nature,’ with

on comparatively inferior ends.”</p>

<p>But, laying aside all question of appeal to that
formidable tribunal, posterity, the many contemporaries
who have owed hours of refined enjoyment
to his graceful talent will join heartily
with Thackeray in his assertion: “It is comfortable
that there should have been a Willis.”</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES</h2>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This statement needs, however, some qualification. Mr.
Clark, of Clark &amp; Maynard, who publish Willis’s poems, tells
me that there is a steady sale for these of about two hundred
copies annually. Fifty years after date this is not bad.
How many copies of <cite>Something and Other Poems</cite>, issued in
1884, will be asked for at the booksellers’ in the year of grace
1934? The copyright of most of Willis’s poems having lately
expired, a cheap reprint of them has just been put forth, bearing
date 1884 and forming No. 352 of “Lovell’s Library.”
This seems to point to a continued popular demand. His
prose writings are at present out of print. The fourth volume
of <cite>Stories by American Authors</cite> contains his “Two Buckets
in a Well,” and it is understood that the publishers of that
series have in mind the publication of a volume of selections
from Willis’s prose.</p>

a title is almost as much to be respected as his text. In
this instance, Willis’s own selection was not only much the
better, but it is interesting as probably suggested to him by
lines that were favorites of his in Longfellow’s translation
from Uhland:&mdash;</p>

<h3 id="BIBLIOGRAPHY">BIBLIOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p>The following is a list of the first editions of Willis’s
books. In a few instances these were published
first in England. In such cases the London edition
only is given. Most of his later works were published
simultaneously, or nearly so, in England and America.
In such cases only the first American edition is given.
Of the various collective editions of his verse, published
since 1844, only the final and most complete is
mentioned, viz., the Clark &amp; Maynard edition of
1868 (No. 29). No really complete edition of Willis’s
writings has ever been printed. The first collective
edition which laid claim to being complete was
entitled: The Complete Works of N. P. Willis. 1
vol., 895 pp. New York: J. S. Redfield, 1846.
The thirteen volumes in uniform style, issued by
Charles Scribner from 1849 to 1859, form as nearly
a complete edition of Willis’s prose since 1846 as is
ever likely to be made.</p>

<p class="center">“WASHINGTON IRVING.”</p>

<p>Mr. Warner has not only written with sympathy, minute
knowledge of his subject, fine literary taste, and that
easy, fascinating style which always puts him on such
good terms with his readers, but he has shown a tact,
critical sagacity, and sense of proportion full of promise
for the rest of the series which is to pass under his
supervision.&mdash;<cite>New York Tribune.</cite></p>

<p>It is a very charming piece of literary work, and presents
the reader with an excellent picture of Irving as a
man and of his methods as an author, together with an
accurate and discriminating characterization of his works.&mdash;<cite>Boston
Journal.</cite></p>

<p>It would hardly be possible to produce a fairer or more
candid book of its kind.&mdash;<cite>Literary World</cite> (London).</p>

<p class="center">“NOAH WEBSTER.”</p>

<p>Mr. Scudder’s biography of Webster is alike honorable
to himself and its subject. Finely discriminating in all
that relates to personal and intellectual character, scholarly
and just in its literary criticisms, analyses, and
estimates, it is besides so kindly and manly in its tone, its
narrative is so spirited and enthralling, its descriptions
are so quaintly graphic, so varied and cheerful in their
coloring, and its pictures so teem with the bustle, the
movement, and the activities of the real life of a by-gone
but most interesting age, that the attention of the reader
is never tempted to wander, and he lays down the book
with a sigh of regret for its brevity.&mdash;<cite>Harper’s Monthly
Magazine.</cite></p>

<p>It fills completely its place in the purpose of this series
of volumes.&mdash;<cite>The Critic</cite> (New York).</p>

<p class="center">“HENRY D. THOREAU.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sanborn’s book is thoroughly American and truly
fascinating. Its literary skill is exceptionally good, and
there is a racy flavor in its pages and an amount of exact
knowledge of interesting people that one seldom meets
with in current literature. Mr. Sanborn has done Thoreau’s
genius an imperishable service.&mdash;<cite>American Church
Review</cite> (New York).</p>

<p>Mr. Sanborn has written a careful book about a curious
man, whom he has studied as impartially as possible;
whom he admires warmly but with discretion; and the
story of whose life he has told with commendable frankness
and simplicity.&mdash;<cite>New York Mail and Express.</cite></p>

<p>It is undoubtedly the best life of Thoreau extant.&mdash;<cite>Christian
Advocate</cite> (New York).</p>

<p class="center">“GEORGE RIPLEY.”</p>

<p>Mr. Frothingham’s memoir is a calm and thoughtful
and tender tribute. It is marked by rare discrimination,
and good taste and simplicity. The biographer keeps
himself in the background, and lets his subject speak.
And the result is one of the best examples of personal
portraiture that we have met with in a long time.&mdash;<cite>The
Churchman</cite> (New York).</p>

<p>He has fulfilled his responsible task with admirable
fidelity, frank earnestness, justice, fine feeling, balanced
moderation, delicate taste, and finished literary skill. It
is a beautiful tribute to the high-bred scholar and generous-hearted
man, whose friend he has so worthily portrayed.&mdash;<cite>Rev.
William H. Channing</cite> (London).</p>

<p class="center">“JAMES FENIMORE COOPER.”</p>

<p>We have here a model biography. The book is charmingly
written, with a felicity and vigor of diction that are
notable, and with a humor sparkling, racy, and never
obtrusive. The story of the life will have something of
the fascination of one of the author’s own romances.&mdash;<cite>New
York Tribune.</cite></p>

<p>Prof. Lounsbury’s book is an admirable specimen of
literary biography.… We can recall no recent addition
to American biography in any department which is superior
to it. It gives the reader not merely a full account
of Cooper’s literary career, but there is mingled with this
a sufficient account of the man himself apart from his
books, and of the period in which he lived, to keep
alive the interest from the first word to the last.&mdash;<cite>New
York Evening Post.</cite></p>

<p class="center">“MARGARET FULLER OSSOLI.”</p>

<p>Here at last we have a biography of one of the noblest
and the most intellectual of American women, which does
full justice to its subject. The author has had ample
material for his work,&mdash;all the material now available,
perhaps,&mdash;and has shown the skill of a master in his
use of it.… It is a fresh view of the subject, and adds
important information to that already given to the public.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rev.
Dr. F. H. Hedge</span>, in <cite>Boston Advertiser</cite>.</p>

<p>He has filled a gap in our literary history with excellent
taste, with sound judgment, and with that literary
skill which is preëminently his own.&mdash;<cite>Christian Union</cite>
(New York).</p>

<p>Mr. Higginson writes with both enthusiasm and sympathy,
and makes a volume of surpassing interest.&mdash;<cite>Commercial
Advertiser</cite> (New York).</p>

<p class="center">“RALPH WALDO EMERSON.”</p>

<p>Dr. Holmes has written one of the most delightful
biographies that has ever appeared. Every page sparkles
with genius. His criticisms are trenchant, his analysis
clear, his sense of proportion delicate, and his sympathies
broad and deep.&mdash;<cite>Philadelphia Press.</cite></p>

<p>A biography of Emerson by Holmes is a real event in
American Literature.&mdash;<cite>Standard</cite> (Chicago).</p>

<p class="center">“EDGAR ALLAN POE.”</p>

<p>Mr. Woodberry has contrived with vast labor to construct
what must hereafter be called the authoritative
biography of Poe, a biography which corrects all others,
supplements all others, and supersedes all others.&mdash;<cite>The
Critic</cite> (New York).</p>

<p>The best life of Poe that has yet been written, and no
better one is likely to be written hereafter. This is high
praise, but it is deserved. Mr. Woodberry has spared no
pains in exploring sources of information; he has shown
rare judgment and discretion in the interpretation of what
he has found.&mdash;<cite>Commercial Advertiser</cite> (New York).</p>

<p class="center">“NATHANIEL PARKER WILLIS.”</p>

<p>Prof. Beers has done his work sympathetically yet candidly
and fairly and in a philosophic manner, indicating
the status occupied by Willis in the republic of letters,
and sketching graphically his literary environment and
the main springs of his success. It is one of the best
books of an excellent series.&mdash;<cite>Buffalo Times.</cite></p>

<p class="center">“BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.”</p>

<p>One of the most interesting and instructive volumes of
the series, overflowing with instructive matter concerning
the Bostonian whose name is so closely identified with
the history of Philadelphia, and, indeed, with that of the
whole country as it existed in his day. The pictures
which are given of the momentous period in which he
lived are full of vigor, and betray an astonishing amount
of research in many directions. The simplicity of style
and the critical ability so abundantly displayed make the
work very fascinating reading throughout. The estimate
of Franklin’s character, ability, and attainments is a very
just one.&mdash;<cite>Boston Gazette.</cite></p>

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
